      "X-ray-based analytics are routinely applied in many fields, including physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering. The full potential of such techniques in the life sciences and medicine, however, has not yet been fully exploited. We highlight current and upcoming advances in this direction. We describe different X-ray-based methodologies (including those performed at synchrotron light sources and X-ray free-electron lasers) and their potentials for application to investigate the nano–bio interface. The discussion is predominantly guided by asking how such methods could better help to understand and to improve nanoparticle-based drug delivery, though the concepts also apply to nano–bio interactions in general. We discuss current limitations and how they might be overcome, particularly for future use\n",

      "Several drugs on the market consist of more than just a homogeneous pill for oral delivery or the injection of a solution for intravenous administration, but are intrinsically heterogeneous, comprising multiple compounds. In the case of nanoparticle (NP)-based drugs, they usually involve a particulate delivery vehicle and a pharmaceutically active compound, which is to be delivered to and released at the target site. This concept reaches back decades,\n",
      "(1)\n",
      "well before the actual term “nanomedicine”, under which such NP-based drugs nowadays are referred, was coined. Examples include Abraxane, where the pharmaceutical therapeutic paclitaxel is delivered\n",

      "(3)\n",
      "However, before reaching acceptance for clinical use, such NP-based systems (as with any drug) have to undergo rigorous clinical trials. Apart from probing the biological effects of the drug (\n",
      "i\n",
      ".\n",
      "e\n",
      "., pharmacodynamics), testing also involves characterization of the drug itself and the NP vehicle, specifically, its pharmacokinetics.\n",
      "Independent of the route of administration (\n",

      ".\n",
      "g\n",
      "., oral, intravenous,\n",
      "etc\n",

      "etc.\n",
      ", are used to shape the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug.\n",
      "(4)\n",
      "At the dawn of nanotechnology, novel and fascinating opportunities for drug formulations emerge. For instance, it has been demonstrated that the therapeutic window of approved drugs will dramatically expand, if dissipated into a nanocrystalline formulation.\n",
      "(5)\n",
      "Far beyond established methodologies, nanotechnology enhances the targeted delivery and controlled release onto the cellular and even subcellular levels, hence emulating fundamental biological mechanisms, such as cell–cell or cell-messenger interactions. Albeit much more sophisticated, nanoformulations have to meet the same regulatory requirements of pharmacovigilance as conventional drugs with respect to effectiveness, efficacy, safety, and benefit.\n",
      "(6)\n",
      "However, due to the cardinal differences compared to conventional drugs, improved methods are urgently needed to monitor the adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion-toxicity (ADME-T) profile of a NP-based drug.\n",
      "Figure\n",
      "1\n",
      "depicts a scenario in which a hypothetical patient is being treated with an intravenously injected NP-based drug. We describe the NP-based drug with a model system composed of the NP carrier matrix/vehicle, which is modified on its surface with a coating that provides colloidal stability, could help to minimize immune response, and might also carry targeting ligands, and an encapsulated or appended pharmaceutical compound.\n",
      "(7,8)\n",
      "However, such a NP-based drug is not a static assembly and, after its administration to the human body, may undergo changes in composition.\n",
      "(9)\n",
      "The fate of the NP-based drug over time thus becomes an important consideration. As expected, initially, a part of the NP-based drugs will be cleared from circulation by the immune system and end up in the liver and spleen, while some fraction will arrive at the actual target site, such as a tumor.\n",
      "(10,11)\n",
      "On the route to reach the target site, however, there are several scenarios that can render delivery less efficient. For example, the surfaces of NP-based drugs may be overcoated due to the formation of a protein corona\n",
      "(12)\n",
      "or may suffer enzymatic degradation of their targeting moieties.\n",
      "(9)\n",
      "Ultimately, these surface changes may worsen the capability of the NP-based drug to achieve active targeting, which depends on ligand density.\n",
      "(13)\n",
      "If all targeting ligands are cleaved, there will no longer be active targeting. Even partial cleavage may have dramatic effects on targeting, if multivalent interactions play roles in target recognition.\n",
      "(14)\n",
      "Furthermore, degradation of the surface coating\n",
      "(15)\n",
      "may also lead to the agglomeration of the carrier NPs and thus potentially induce clogging of the blood vessels.\n",
      "(16)\n",
      "Besides agglomeration, degradation can lead to significantly altered chemical surface structures with respect to polarity or charge. These changes, in turn, will impact in the biodistribution of a NP-based drug by altering its solubility, ability for serum protein binding, and membrane permeability. Finally, degradation of the carrier NP vehicle in the blood may also lead to the loss of the pharmaceutical compound before it actually reaches the target site. In this case, there would be no biological effects as a result of treatment with the NP-based drug, as only the empty NP carrier, but not the embedded pharmaceutical compound, would reach the target site. Thus, as different parts of NP-based drugs degrade over time, following\n",
      "in vivo\n",
      "the fate of their individual components is important to understand what is exactly delivered to the target site. Equally important is understanding the efficacy of the targeting strategy chosen to enrich the NP-based drug in its target and the delivery efficiency of the drug from the NP carrier once it has reached it. Again, if the intact NP carrier is not capable of accumulating in the areas that need to be treated (\n",

      "Moreover, once at the target site, NP-based drugs need to penetrate into the tissue and typically get internalized by cells (usually through endosomal pathways), where the pharmaceutical component is supposed to be released into the cytosol. Therefore, targeted drug delivery and controlled drug release represent important parts of drug delivery. Keeping in mind that only a small fraction of the drug or the NP carrier will reach the target and that the drug may cause side effects in other organs, ensuring stable encapsulation that only releases the toxic drug/pharmaceutical agent at the target site would be advantageous. Following this approach, the drug would be released from the NP carrier once the carrier reaches the target tissue, and thus the therapeutic effect would be limited to the immediate vicinity of the target cells, with maximum efficacy. Several strategies have been developed for controlled release, including site-activated release, for example, based on environment sensing mechanisms or by triggering heat dissipation from magnetic NPs embedded in liposomes. For environment-sensing drug release, several approaches based on pH-dependent release have been reported, premised on the observation that pH levels can be different in pathological (\n",
      "e\n",
      ".\n",
      "g\n",
      "., inflamed or infected) tissues or cells. Lipid structures can be made responsive to pH changes, so they are ideal for environment-sensing delivery systems, both for extracellular as well as intracellular release. To understand the release of the pharmacological agent from the NP carrier vehicle, the localization of each of the components needs to be mapped with subcellular resolution. The localization and transformations of the different units of the NP-based drug are important for its biological activity. For example, pharmaceutical compounds can lead to completely different cellular effects depending on their intracellular location (\n",
      "e\n",
      ".\n",
      "g\n",
      "., therapeutic agents acting at the mRNA level would be ineffective if they are confined to endosomes/lysosomes and not released to the cytosol, where the mRNA is located).\n",
      "(18)\n",
      "Also, metal cores (\n",
      "e\n",
      ".\n",
      "g\n",
      "., for NP carrier vehicles) may undergo a variety of transformations once internalized by cells/tissue, which might be vital to understanding the activity or potential risks of NP-based drugs due to NP-induced toxicity (\n",
      "e\n",
      ".\n",
      "g\n",
      "., release of Ag\n",
      "+\n",
      "when using Ag-based carriers).\n",
      "(19−24)\n",
      "Thus, in order to understand the effects of NP-based drugs, biological responses need to be correlated to the intracellular locations,\n",
      "(25)\n",
      "speciation, and behavior of the different compounds of the NP-based drug.\n",
      "However, it is difficult to obtain information about the structural rearrangements in the delivery system while in a liquid environment. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has been used to study these processes and is now an essential tool to gather information and to fine-tune lipid drug release systems.\n",
      "(26−29)\n",
      "Alternatively, drugs can be released from liposomes that incorporate sphingomyelin in their membranes. If such sphingomyelin-liposomes are in contact with the enzyme sphingomyelinase (expressed by stressed cells in tumors or inflammatory tissue), the lipid molecule is broken down into its constituents, ceramide and phosphorylcholine. These molecules no longer have an optimal fit, so the liposome membrane becomes more permeable, and the contents of the liposomes are released. X-ray-based techniques can be used to study these microdomain changes for optimized drug release. External activation methods using magnetic fields have also been developed as an additional means of controlled drug release.\n",
      "(30)\n",
      "Here, ferric NP-containing liposomes are used. Once enough drug carriers have accumulated at the target site, an external alternating magnetic field is directed at the desired location and membrane disruption induced from local heating or by mechanical actuation results in a leaky liposome membrane and subsequent drug release. The synergistic effect of the enzyme and the applied magnetic field induces a more potent and selective release than a single approach alone.\n",
      "(31,32)\n",
      "Again, for the selection of optimized ferric NPs and monitoring conformal changes leading to the release of the drug, X-ray-based analyses are most valuable. In order to study the process, different markers can be attached to the carrier (to monitor delivery) and the drug (to monitor release).\n",
      "The examples presented here illustrate the potential of NP carriers with mechanisms for controlled release. Related alternative approaches have been reviewed recently.\n",
      "(33)\n",
      "The development of improved luminescent NPs is of interest for targeted drug delivery as well. Photoactive NPs that respond to near-infrared (NIR) excitation could be used for spatially targeted delivery, as NIR light penetrates tissue to greater depths than shorter wavelengths with considerably less phototoxicity.\n",
      "(34,35)\n",
      "Upconverting NPs (UCNPs) make use of energy-transfer upconversion between neighboring lanthanide ions to convert tissue-penetrating NIR light efficiently to visible or UV light. Targeted UCNPs can be used to release therapeutics through UV-based uncaging strategies, creating highly localized light sources of wavelengths that might otherwise be cytotoxic.\n",
      "(36−38)\n",
      "The stable optical response of these NPs also enables extended tracking\n",
      "(39,40)\n",
      "as well as sensitive detection of cellular fluctuations in response to temperature and pressure.\n",
      "(41−43)\n",
      "Moreover, UCNPs have been shown to excite retinal opsins to endow mice with NIR vision\n",
      "(44)\n",
      "as well as to power optogenetic switches in awake mouse brains,\n",
      "(45)\n",
      "suggesting that even more complex therapeutic strategies are possible with these NIR-responsive NPs. For each of these NP-based approaches, understanding the fate of NP-based drugs in biological organisms is of vital importance to improve their potential medical applications.\n",
      "All of these aspects require efficient imaging or spectroscopic tools to study the behavior of NP-based drugs\n",
      "in situ\n",
      "in biological environments or whole biological samples such as small animals, allowing direct detection of the different components of the NP-based drugs (to overcome the loss of information as a result of their degradation) and, more importantly, providing high spatial resolution. In mapping the fate of NPs, it is desirable to access different size scales, ranging from subcellular resolution to full organisms (\n",
      "i\n",
      ".\n",
      "e\n",
      "., humans or small animals). Therefore, if a single analytical technique is to be used, it should be capable of changing magnification, to provide optimal spatial resolution according to the requirements of the sample to be analyzed.\n",
      "The functionalization of NP surfaces is critical for targeting therapeutics to organs and cells of interest and for minimizing toxicity and off-target effects. Intrinsically hydrophobic NPs must be transformed into being hydrophilic by surface functionalization, and this combination  of aqueous surface passivation and biomolecule targeting determines the interactions of the NPs with living systems. While many NP–biomolecule complexes have been assembled by nonspecific or reversible linkages, the challenge of maintaining the stability of these complexes within tissue has spawned a number of bioconjugation strategies to attach proteins and organic ligands covalently to NP surfaces, with controlled stoichiometry.\n",
      "(46−50)\n",
      "Identifying a suitable labeling approach for deciphering the degradation processes occurring in the NP-coatings while keeping the efficiency of targeting or delivery of the drug is not straightforward. The label needs to be stable (to limit degradation throughout the course of the study) and detectable with analytical techniques of high sensitivity and resolution. But most of all, it needs to be modular, in the sense that it should allow chemoselective conjugation to the region of interest, for example, by immobilization on metallic NPs or covalently linked to organic coatings on the surface of the NPs (which helps to understand degradation and targeting) or to the drug embedded (which provides vital information about delivery to the target).\n",
      "(51)\n",
      "In this context, bifunctional metal chelators such as 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid and its derivatives enable the introduction of various labels as tracers into the coating of NPs and may thus be used for detailed analysis of degradation processes.\n",
      "(52)\n",
      "This includes radiolabels compatible with positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging,\n",
      "(53)\n",
      "nonradioactive heavy metals compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and NIR fluorescence, or elemental labels with high contrast in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and X-ray detection (such as X-ray fluorescence imaging, XFI).\n",
      "(54−57)\n",
      "Nevertheless, any modification of the structure of a drug might alter its therapeutic activity and biological behavior, an important consideration that must be understood and considered before deciding upon one or more labels.\n",
      "In addition to using NPs alone as drug delivery vehicles, it is also possible to integrate NPs within different types of materials or as components of gels. Integration of NPs within hydrogels allows improving the mechanical, biological, and chemical properties of the material. One example of this strategy is the integration of nanosilicates, such as Laponite, within polymers that form shear-thinning hydrogels. Such nanosilicates have charge distributions that allow them to interact with gelatin polymers by electrostatic interactions forming bonds that can be broken upon application of force. The incorporation of Laponite within gelatin has been shown to form hydrogels that can be used for various regenerative applications as well as medical devices for embolization.\n",
      "(58)\n",
      "These hydrogels have shown great potential; one advantage is their ability to be delivered through catheters and utilized in minimally invasive manners. Unfortunately, some of these materials are not radio-opaque by themselves. In such cases, the addition of contrast agents such as tantalum can make these hydrogels visible to X-rays and thus suitable for computed tomography (CT) scans and other X-ray techniques. Integration of nanomaterials with non-invasive imaging approaches provides opportunities to address a number of issues such as internal bleeding, aneurysms, and other medical problems. Ultimately\n",

      "These techniques could also be applied to a wide variety of NP-based drugs. Conversely, the identification of ideal drug delivery systems to study under X-ray techniques can facilitate the use of existing infrastructure to observe nano–bio interactions that previously could only be inferred. For example, crystalline materials such as liposomes, metal NPs, and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)-based NPs have distinct X-rays scattering profiles. In particular, MOFs can also be loaded with therapeutics and engineered to disassemble in acidic microenvironments, meaning that dissolution of the MOF carrier system could be monitored by SAXS. This process would not require any labels and would also give information on whether the NPs fracture to release cargo, to disassemble into crystallites, or to dissolve completely during internalization. The reverse time course (formation instead of dissolution) has been performed by looking at the formation of MOFs on the cell walls/membranes of microorganisms.\n",

First, biological samples normally contain low concentrations of the NPs of interest, making it necessary to use relatively long acquisition times on instruments providing high photon fluxes to obtain high-quality images. Furthermore, many X-ray imaging techniques use scanning-based approaches needing mechanical translation of the sample during acquisition, which takes longer for higher resolution images.

The interactions of photons with soft matter are dominated in the soft energy X-ray range by the photoelectric effect and in the hard X-ray energy range above 50 keV by Compton scattering. X-rays are orders of magnitude more penetrating than charged particles. The attenuation of the beam increases exponentially with the thickness of the sample and decreases with increasing X-ray energy. The intensity of the beam is attenuated by 1/e (attenuation length) after transmission of soft tissue, for example, through 30 μm (cell), 300 μm (cell spheroid), 3 mm (tumor), and 30 mm (organ) at energies of 2.4, 5.4, 11.8, and 33 keV, respectively.\n",

      "., a beam composed of X-rays with a range of energies from a minimum of about 25 kV, depending on the filtering used, up to the maximum selected). The high penetration depth of X-rays can be employed to obtain real 3D imaging by tomographic methods, usually by computational reconstruction of virtual slices from a series of projections recorded at various angles. Being tiny and sparse, NPs in a tissue can only be investigated in 3D if the local tomographic resolution approaches the size of the NP itself, which requires coherent scattering techniques such as X-ray holotomography or ptychographic tomography and small sample volumes. The sensitivity for NPs can be increased by selecting XRF contrast. When composed of heavy elements inside a light matrix, NPs generate an XRF signal that can be efficiently separated from the background signal by energy dispersive detectors. XRF tomography enables measuring intrinsic trace element distributions with parts-per-million sensitivity in cells without the need to add or to encode genetically-specific fluorescent labels. However, the spatial resolution is limited by the X-ray optics used, to about 60 nm in 3D. Indeed, XRF tomography is a raster scanning technique utilizing a pencil beam, and as a consequence, this technique is comparatively slow. The measurement of a mega voxel 3D image can easily take several hours. On the other hand, XRF tomography offers free spatial scalability. The size of the scanned volume is generally limited by the available measurement time once a suitable beam size is selected. For thick samples, the “over absorption” of the X-ray fluorescence radiation emitted from the NP inside the sample matrix is important. For Au NPs, for example, the L\n",

The corresponding diameters and dispersibility of the SPs calculated from SAXS data matched the TEM, SEM, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) data. Together, they determine the sizes of SPs both in solution and in dry state and observed dense packing of the NPs. Data fitting using three different form factor models revealed a core–shell sphere as the most likely possibility.

      "The mechanism of radiation injury depends predominantly on the changes of biological macromolecules with exposure to X-rays. Radiation can directly interact with biological macromolecules and induce their ionization and excitation, resulting in molecular structure changes and loss of biological activity. Free radicals formed by X-rays can, in turn, damage biomolecules and, in particular, DNA. Meanwhile, the ionized and excited molecules are unstable, and the electronic structure within the molecules can be changed. This process can induce decomposition of molecules and changes in their structure, leading to the loss of biological function, especially when chromosomal DNA is affected.\n",
      "Importantly, in the study of living organisms, radiative injury depends on many factors, including exposure-related factors (\n",

      "Various hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, naive hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, and mature blood cells in lymphatic tissues are sensitive to radiation. Particularly when the bone marrow is exposed to large doses of X-rays, hematopoietic stem cells suffer a greater degree of radiation damage, and their self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation will appear unbalanced, manifested as weakened self-renewal, resulting in serious reductions or even depletions of hematopoietic stem cells, which ultimately leads to bone marrow hematopoietic failure and loss of immune function. Although tremendous progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of radiation damage, there remains major scientific issues that need to be studied and overcome. These issues include not only the differences in radiosensitivity of different tissues and organs and the physiological damage caused to sensitive tissues and organs under high-dose irradiation but also the development of countermeasures against normal tissue radiation injury. The cumulative radiation dose should also be considered in preclinical animal models. In order to reach an optimal signal-to-noise ratio and high spatial resolution in X-ray-based analyses, relatively high radiation doses are necessary. Such high doses will not allow repeated measurements since high total body doses are lethal because of the bone marrow suppression. Second, high radiation doses certainly affect the experimental animal models and outcomes, that is, immune responses, tumor microenvironment, and/or tumor growth. Thus, the fate and therapeutic effect of NPs measured by X-ray-based methods should be re-evaluated using multimodality methods considering the effects of cumulative radiation doses on the animals.\n",

Treatment decisions are made by multidisciplinary teams consisting of medical specialists of various disciplines, who collect history, clinical information, family and genetic data, laboratory data, and imaging data about the patient. Spatial information provided by imaging is an essential pillar of many diagnostic as well as therapeutic interventions, such as biopsy, surgery, radiation therapy, and minimally invasive focal as well as systemic therapies. Therapy planning and response are not only based on precise information on the localization, extension, and spreading of the tumor but also on the individual anatomy of the healthy structures.

Various methods of ultrasound, CT, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET/CT and PET/MRI), along with advances in computer science, provide high-resolution 3D visualization of anatomical and functional tumor features.

      "1.  A phase I trial of a cisplatin-albumin complex for the treatment of end-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is reported.  The complex was prepared by overnight incubation of cisplatin with human albumin at 37 degrees C.  This resulted in more than 98% of the drug being bound to protein at the start of treatment.  The patients were either unable to continue with or had refused conventional therapy with cisplatin. 2.  The trial began at a dose of 100 mg cisplatin m-2 and was increased in 25 mg m-2 increments to 650 mg m-2.  Despite the absence of the customary protective measures of pre-hydration and anti-emetic treatment no serious toxicity was encountered. 3.  Unbound plasma platinum concentrations were lower than after conventional cisplatin treatment but total plasma platinum and tumour platinum concentrations were much higher.  Urinary excretion of platinum was low and the incidence of nephrotoxicity was greatly diminished.  Two responses were seen (one complete and one partial) in 38 patients treated and the median survival time was 109 days, compared with 151 days for patients treated conventionally with cisplatin and 56 days for untreated patients. 4.  The complex is not as effective as conventional cisplatin therapy but is much less toxic, offers improved quality of life during treatment and may prove to be of benefit in patients who could not otherwise be treated.\n",

      "A review.  Solvent-based delivery vehicles for chemotherapy agents have been instrumental in providing a means for hydrophobic agents to be administered i.v.  These solvents, however, have been assocd. with serious and dose-limiting toxicities.  Solvent-based formulations of taxanes, a highly active class of cytotoxic agents, are assocd. with hypersensitivity reactions, neutropenia, and neuropathy.  Nanoparticle technol. utilizing the human protein albumin exploits natural pathways to selectively deliver larger amts. of drug to tumors while avoiding some of the toxicities of solvent-based formulations. 130-nM albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane) was recently approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed combination therapy.  In a randomized, phase III study in metastatic breast cancer, nab-paclitaxel had improved efficacy and safety compared with conventional, solvent-based paclitaxel.  Preliminary data also suggest roles for nab-paclitaxel as a single agent and in combination therapy for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer as well as in other solid tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and malignant melanoma.  The nab technol. promises to have broad utility in cancer therapy, and clin. trials are underway using nab formulations of other water-insol. anticancer agents such as docetaxel and rapamycin.\n",

      "A review.  Doxil, the first FDA-approved nano-drug (1995), is based on three unrelated principles: (i) prolonged drug circulation time and avoidance of the RES due to the use of PEGylated nano-liposomes; (ii) high and stable remote loading of doxorubicin driven by a transmembrane ammonium sulfate gradient, which also allows for drug release at the tumor; and (iii) having the liposome lipid bilayer in a liq. ordered phase composed of the high-Tm (53 °C) phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol.  Due to the EPR effect, Doxil is passively targeted to tumors and its doxorubicin is released and becomes available to tumor cells by as yet unknown means.  This review summarizes historical and scientific perspectives of Doxil development and lessons learned from its development and 20 years of its use.  It demonstrates the obligatory need for applying an understanding of the cross talk between physicochem., nano-technol., and biol. principles.  However, in spite of the large reward, ~ 2 years after Doxil-related patents expired, there is still no FDA-approved generic Doxil available.\n",

      "A review.  A medicine consists of 2 fundamental parts: the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the excipient.  Most, if not all, medicines could not be made without the use of excipients.  In the early times, the safety of excipients was overlooked and no specific safety tests were generally conducted.  This fact has been changed over times and is currently being recognized that the excipient's toxicity is not negligible, because its direct interaction with the active pharmaceutical ingredient or between other excipients may occur, leading to a potential change in the relationship between effectiveness and toxicity.  This review is intended to address the general status of the pharmaceutical excipients and to describe the safety assessment.  As a summary, this review suggests the interest of simplifying the formulations as much as possible and the interest of reducing the no. of excipients necessary to strictly meet the required functions.  The risk/benefit ratio of an excipient should be always evaluated on the basis of not only its prodn. and quality but also of its safety.  Further research according to Good Manufg. Practices, Guiding Principles in Toxicol. Assessment, Good Lab. Practices, and Good Distribution Practices requirements are needed and are fundamental for health safety, contributing to a comprehensive picture of this matter.\n",

Transfer of materials into the nanodimension changes their phys. properties which were used in pharmaceutics to develop a new innovative formulation principle for poorly sol. drugs: the drug nanocrystals.  The drug nanocrystals do not belong to the future; the first products are already on the market.  The industrially relevant prodn. technologies, pearl milling and high pressure homogenization, are reviewed.  The physics behind the drug nanocrystals and changes of their phys. properties are discussed.  The marketed products are presented and the special phys. effects of nanocrystals explained which are utilized in each market product.  Examples of products in the development pipelines (clin. phases) are presented and the benefits for in vivo administration of drug nanocrystals are summarized in an overview.\n",

      "A review.  In soln., nanoparticles may be conceptually compartmentalized into cores and engineered surface coatings.  Recent advances allow for simple and accurate characterization of nanoparticle cores and surface shells.  After introduction into complex biol. environment, adsorption of biol. mols. to the nanoparticle surface as well as a loss of original surface components occur.  Thus, colloidal nanoparticles in the context of biol. environment are hybrid materials with complex structure, which may result in different chem., phys., and biol. outcomes as compared to the original engineered nanoparticles.  In this perspective, the authors will discuss building up an engineered inorg. nanoparticle from its inside core to its outside surface, and following its degrdn. in biol. environment from its outside to its inside.  This will involve the way to synthesize selected inorg. nanoparticles.  Then, the authors will discuss the environmental changes upon exposure of these nanoparticles to biol. media and their uptake by cells.  Next, the intracellular fate of nanoparticles and their degrdn. will be discussed.  Based on the examples the need to see nanoparticles in the context of biol. environment as dynamic hybrid materials will be highlighted.\n",

      "A review.  What happens to inorg. nanoparticles (NPs), such as plasmonic gold or silver, superparamagnetic iron oxide, or fluorescent quantum dot NPs after they have been administrated to a living being.  This review discusses the integrity, biodistribution, and fate of NPs after in vivo administration.  The hybrid nature of the NPs is described, conceptually divided into the inorg. core, the engineered surface coating comprising of the ligand shell and optionally also bio-conjugates, and the corona of adsorbed biol. mols.  Empirical evidence shows that all of these three compds. may degrade individually in vivo and can drastically modify the life cycle and biodistribution of the whole heterostructure.  Thus, the NPs may be decompd. into different parts, whose biodistribution and fate would need to be analyzed individually.  Multiple labeling and quantification strategies for such a purpose will be discussed.  All reviewed data indicate that NPs in vivo should no longer be considered as homogeneous entities, but should be seen as inorg./org./biol. nano-hybrids with complex and intricately linked distribution and degrdn. pathways.\n",

      "Targeted delivery approaches for cancer therapeutics have shown a steep rise over the past few decades.  However, compared to the plethora of successful pre-clinical studies, only 15 passively targeted nanocarriers (NCs) have been approved for clinical use and none of the actively targeted NCs have advanced past clinical trials.  Herein, we review the principles behind targeted delivery approaches to determine potential reasons for their limited clinical translation and success.  We propose criteria and considerations that must be taken into account for the development of novel actively targeted NCs.  We also highlight the possible directions for the development of successful tumor targeting strategies.\n",

      "Nanoparticles have been proposed as carriers for drugs, genes and therapies to treat various diseases.  Many strategies have been developed to target nanomaterials to specific or over-expressed receptors in diseased cells, and these typically involve functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with proteins, antibodies or other biomols.  Here, we show that the targeting ability of such functionalized nanoparticles may disappear when they are placed in a biol. environment.  Using transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles, we found that proteins in the media can shield transferrin from binding to both its targeted receptors on cells and sol. transferrin receptors.  Although nanoparticles continue to enter cells, the targeting specificity of transferrin is lost.  Our results suggest that when nanoparticles are placed in a complex biol. environment, interaction with other proteins in the medium and the formation of a protein corona can 'screen' the targeting mols. on the surface of nanoparticles and cause loss of specificity in targeting.\n",

      "Active targeting of nanoparticles to tumors can be achieved by conjugation with specific antibodies.  Specific active targeting of the HER2 receptor is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo with a s.c. MCF-7 breast cancer mouse model with trastuzumab-functionalized gold nanoparticles.  The no. of attached antibodies per nanoparticle was precisely controlled in a way that each nanoparticle was conjugated with either exactly one or exactly two antibodies.  As expected, in vitro we found a moderate increase in targeting efficiency of nanoparticles with two instead of just one antibody attached per nanoparticle.  However, the in vivo data demonstrate that best effect is obtained for nanoparticles with only exactly one antibody.  There is indication that this is based on a size-related effect.  These results highlight the importance of precisely controlling the ligand d. on the nanoparticle surface for optimizing active targeting, and that less antibodies can exhibit more effect.\n",

      "A review.  Multivalent interactions can be applied universally for a targeted strengthening of an interaction between different interfaces or mols.  The binding partners form cooperative, multiple receptor-ligand interactions that are based on individually weak, noncovalent bonds and are thus generally reversible.  Hence, multi- and polyvalent interactions play a decisive role in biol. systems for recognition, adhesion, and signal processes.  The scientific and practical realization of this principle will be demonstrated by the development of simple artificial and theor. models, from natural systems to functional, application-oriented systems.  In a systematic review of scaffold architectures, the underlying effects and control options will be demonstrated, and suggestions will be given for designing effective multivalent binding systems, as well as for polyvalent therapeutics.\n",

      "Inorg. nanoparticles are frequently engineered with an org. surface coating to improve their physicochem. properties, and it is well known that their colloidal properties may change upon internalization by cells.  While the stability of such nanoparticles is typically assayed in simple in vitro tests, their stability in a mammalian organism remains unknown.  Here, we show that firmly grafted polymer shells around gold nanoparticles may degrade when injected into rats.  We synthesized monodisperse radioactively labeled gold nanoparticles (198Au) and engineered an 111In-labeled polymer shell around them.  Upon i.v. injection into rats, quant. biodistribution analyses performed independently for 198Au and 111In showed partial removal of the polymer shell in vivo.  While 198Au accumulates mostly in the liver, part of the 111In shows a non-particulate biodistribution similar to i.v. injection of chelated 111In.  Further in vitro studies suggest that degrdn. of the polymer shell is caused by proteolytic enzymes in the liver.  Our results show that even nanoparticles with high colloidal stability can change their physicochem. properties in vivo.\n",

      "A review.  The emission of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) into the environment in increasing quantity and variety raises a general concern regarding potential effects on human health.  Compared with sol. substances, ENPs exhibit addnl. dimensions of complexity, i.e., they exist not only in various sizes, shapes and chem. compns. but also in different degrees of agglomeration.  The effect of the latter is the topic of this review in which we explore and discuss the role of agglomeration on toxicity, including the fate of nanomaterials after their release and the biol. effects they may induce.  In-depth investigations of the effect of ENP agglomeration on human health are still rare, but it may be stated that outside the body ENP agglomeration greatly reduces human exposure.  After uptake, agglomeration of ENPs reduces translocation across primary barriers such as lungs, skin or the gastrointestinal tract, preventing exposure of \"secondary\" organs.  In analogy, also cellular ENP uptake and intracellular distribution are affected by agglomeration.  However, agglomeration may represent a risk factor if it occurs after translocation across the primary barriers, and ENPs are able to accumulate within the tissue and thus reduce clearance efficiency.\n",

      "Colloidal CdSe/ZnS quantum dots were water solubilized by overcoating with an amphiphilic polymer.  Human serum albumin (HSA) as a model protein was either adsorbed or chem. linked to the surface of the polymer-coated quantum dots.  As the quantum dots are intrinsically fluorescent, and as the polymer coating and the HSA were fluorescent labeled, the final nanoparticle had three differently fluorescent components: the quantum dot core, the polymer shell, and the human serum albumin corona.  Cells were incubated with these hybrid nanoparticles, and after removal of non-internalized nanoparticles, exocytosis of the three components of the nanoparticles was obsd. individually by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.  The data indicate that HSA is partly transported with the underlying polymer-coated quantum dots into cells.  Upon desorption of proteins, those initially adsorbed to the quantum dots remain longer inside cells compared to free proteins.  Part of the polymer shell is released from the quantum dots by enzymic degrdn., which is on a slower time scale than protein desorption.  Data are quant. analyzed, and exptl. pitfalls, such as the impact of cell proliferation and fluorescence quenching, are discussed.\n",

      "A review.  Because of its safe and effective protein expression profile, in vitro transcribed mRNA (IVT-mRNA) represents a promising candidate in the development of novel therapeutics for genetic diseases, vaccines or gene editing strategies, esp. when its inherent shortcomings (for example, instability and immunogenicity) have been partially addressed via structural modifications.  However, numerous unsolved tech. difficulties in successful in vivo delivery of IVT-mRNA have greatly hindered the applications of IVT-mRNA in clin. development.  Recent advances in nanotechnol. and material science have yielded many promising nonviral delivery systems, some of which were able to efficiently facilitate targeted in vivo delivery of IVT-mRNA in safe and noninvasive manners.  The diversity and flexibility of these delivery systems highlight the recent progress of IVT-mRNA-based therapy using nonviral vectors.  In this review, we summarize recent advances of existing and emerging nonviral vector-based nanotechnologies for IVT-mRNA delivery and briefly summarize the interesting but rarely discussed applications on simultaneous delivery of IVT-mRNA with DNA.\n",

      "A review.  This review paper presents the overview of processes involved in transformation of org.-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in biol. systems and in the aquatic environment.  The coating on AgNPs greatly influences the fate, stability, and toxicity of AgNPs in aq. solns., biol. systems, and the environment.  Several org.-coated AgNP systems are discussed to understand their stability and toxicity in biol. media and natural water.  Examples are presented to demonstrate how a transformation of org.-coated AgNPs in an aq. soln. is affected by the type of coating, pH, kind of electrolyte (mono- or divalent), ionic strength, org. ligands (inorg. and org.), org. matter (fulvic and humic acids), redox conditions (oxic and anoxic), and light.  Results of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and ecotoxicity of coated AgNPs to food chain members (plants, bacteria, and aquatic and terrestrial organisms) are reviewed.  Key factors contributing to toxicity are the size, shape, surface coating, surface charge, and conditions of silver ion release.  AgNPs may directly damage the cell membranes, disrupt ATP prodn. and DNA replication, alternate gene expressions, release toxic Ag+ ion, and produce reactive oxygen species to oxidize biol. components of the cell.  A progress made on understanding the mechanism of org.-coated AgNP toxicity using different anal. techniques is presented.\n",

      "Toxicity of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) has been reported both in vitro and in vivo.  However, the intracellular stability and chem. state of Ag NPs are still not very well studied.  In this work, we systematically investigated the cellular uptake pathways, intracellular dissoln. and chem. species, and cytotoxicity of Ag NPs (15.9 ± 7.6 nm) in Chinese hamster ovary cell subclone K1 cells, a cell line recommended by the OECD for genotoxicity studies.  Quantification of intracellular nanoparticle uptake and ion release was performed through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was employed to assess the chem. state of intracellular silver.  The toxic potential of Ag NPs and Ag+ was evaluated by cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) prodn. and live-dead cell staining.  The results suggest that cellular uptake of Ag NPs involves lipid-raft-mediated endocytosis and energy-independent diffusion.  The degrdn. study shows that Ag NPs taken up into cells dissolved quickly and XANES results directly indicated that the internalized Ag was oxidized to Ag-O- species and then stabilized in silver-sulfur (Ag-S-) bonds within the cells.  Subsequent cytotoxicity studies show that Ag NPs decrease cell viability and increase ROS prodn.  Pre-incubation with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, an efficient antioxidant and Ag+ chelator, diminished the cytotoxicity caused by Ag NPs or Ag+ exposure.  Our study suggests that the cytotoxicity mechanism of Ag NPs is related to the intracellular release of silver ions, followed by their binding to SH-groups, presumably coming from amino acids or proteins, and affecting protein functions and the antioxidant defense system of cells.\n",

      "The toxic effects of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) remain an issue of debate, where the resp. contribution of the NPs themselves and of free Ag+ ions present in the NP stock suspensions and after intracellular NP corrosion are not fully understood.  Here, we employ a recently set up methodol. based on high-content (HC) imaging combined with high-content gene expression studies to examine the interaction of three types of Ag NPs with identical core sizes, but coated with either mercapto-undecanoic acid (MUA), dodecylamine-modified poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PMA), or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-conjugated PMA with two types of cultured cells (primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and murine C17.2 neural progenitor cells).  As a control, cells were also exposed to free Ag+ ions at the same concn. as present in the resp. Ag NP stock suspensions.  The data reveal clear effects of the NP surface properties on cellular interactions.  PEGylation of the NPs significantly reduces their cellular uptake efficiency, whereas MUA-NPs are more prone to agglomeration in complex tissue culture media.  PEG-NPs display the lowest levels of toxicity, which is in line with their reduced cell uptake.  MUA-NPs display the highest levels of toxicity, caused by autophagy, cell membrane damage, mitochondrial damage, and cytoskeletal deformations.  At similar intracellular NP levels, PEG-NPs induce the highest levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but do not affect the cell cytoskeleton, in contrast to MUA- and PMA-NPs.  Gene expression studies support the findings above, defining autophagy and cell membrane damage-related necrosis as main toxicity pathways.  Addnl., immunotoxicity, DNA damage responses, and hypoxia-like toxicity were obsd. for PMA- and esp. MUA-NPs.  Together, these data reveal that Ag+ ions do contribute to Ag NP-assocd. toxicity, particularly upon intracellular degrdn.  The different surface properties of the NPs however result in distinct toxicity profiles for the three NPs, indicating clear NP-assocd. effects.\n",

      "To predict potential medical value or toxicity of nanoparticles (NPs), it is necessary to understand the chem. transformation during intracellular processes of NPs.  However, it is a grand challenge to capture a high-resoln. image of metallic NPs in a single cell and the chem. information on intracellular NPs.  Here, by integrating synchrotron radiation-beam transmission x-ray microscopy (SR-TXM) and SR-x-ray absorption near edge structure (SR-XANES) spectroscopy, the authors successfully capture the 3D distribution of silver NPs (AgNPs) inside a single human monocyte (THP-1), assocd. with the chem. transformation of silver.  The results reveal that the cytotoxicity of AgNPs is largely due to the chem. transformation of particulate silver from elemental silver (Ag0)n, to Ag+ ions and Ag-O-, then Ag-S- species.  These results provide direct evidence in the long-lasting debate on whether the nanoscale or the ionic form dominates the cytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles.  Further, the present approach provides an integrated strategy capable of exploring the chem. origins of cytotoxicity in metallic nanoparticles.\n",

      "Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) toxicity is related to their dissoln. in biol. environments and to the binding of the released Ag+ ions in cellulo; the chem. environment of recombined Ag+ ions is responsible for their toxicol. outcome, moreover it is indicative of the cellular response to AgNP exposure, and can therefore shed light on the mechanisms governing AgNP toxicity.  This study probes the chem. of Ag species in primary murine macrophages exposed to AgNPs by making use of X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy under cryogenic conditions: the linear combination anal. of the near-edge region of the spectra provides the fraction of Ag+ ions released from the AgNPs under a given exposure condition and highlights their complexation with thiolate groups; the ab initio modeling of the extended spectra allows measuring the Ag-S bond length in cellulo.  Dissoln. rates depend on the exposure scenario, chronicity leading to higher Ag+ release than acute exposure; Ag-S bond lengths are 2.41 ± 0.03 Å and 2.38 ± 0.01 Å in acute and chronic exposure resp., compatible with digonal AgS2 coordination.  Glutathione is identified as the most likely putative ligand for Ag+.  The proposed method offers a scope for the investigation of metallic nanoparticle dissoln. and recombination in cellular models.\n",

      "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can enter eukaryotic cells and exert toxic effects, most probably as a consequence of the release of Ag+ ions.  Due to the elusive nature of Ag+ ionic species, quant. information concerning AgNP intracellular dissoln. is missing.  By using a synchrotron nanoprobe, silver is visualized and quantified in hepatocytes (HepG2) exposed to AgNPs; the synergistic use of electron microscopy allows for the discrimination between nanoparticular and ionic forms of silver within a single cell.  AgNPs are located in endocytosis vesicles, while the visualized Ag+ ions diffuse in the cell.  The averaged NP dissoln. rates, measured by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, highlight the faster dissoln. of citrate-coated AgNPs with respect to the less toxic PVP-coated AgNPs; these results are confirmed at the single-cell level.  The released Ag+ ions recombine with thiol-bearing biomols.: the Ag-S distances measured in cellulo, and the quant. evaluation of gene expression, provide independent evidence of the involvement of glutathione and metallothioneins in Ag+ binding.  The combined use of cutting-edge imaging techniques, at. spectroscopy and mol. biol. brings insight into the fate of AgNPs in hepatocytes, and more generally into the physicochem. transformations of metallic nanoparticles in biol. environments and the resulting disruption of metal homeostasis.\n",

      "It is qual. demonstrated that the intracellular localization of particles depends on the way they are administered, their basic physicochem. properties, as well as on incubation time.  For this purpose cells were exposed to fluorescently-labeled particles of different size under different exposure scenarios including incubation, microinjection, electroporation, and sonoporation.  After co-exposure to cells the intracellular distribution of different particles was imaged with multicolor fluorescence microscopy.  Qual. co-localization anal. demonstrates, that different particles to which cells have been exposed in different ways did not automatically reside in the same compartment.

      "The encapsulation and release of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, and drugs in nanostructured lipid carriers depend on the type of the self-assembled liq.-cryst. organization and the structural dimensions of the aq. and membraneous compartments, which can be tuned by the multicomponent compn. of the systems.  In this work, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) investigation is performed on the melting' transition of the bicontinuous double diamond cubic phase, formed by pure glycerol monooleate (MO), upon progressive inclusion of varying fractions of pharmaceutical-grade glycerol monooleate (GO) in the hydrated system.  The self-assembled MO/GO mixts. are found to form diamond (Pn3m) inverted cubic, inverted hexagonal (HII), and sponge (L3) phases at ambient temp. in excess of aq. medium without heat treatment.  Mixing of the inverted-cubic-phase-forming MO and the sponge-phase-forming GO components, in equiv. proportions (50/50 wt./wt.), yields an inverted hexagonal (HII) phase nanostructured carrier.  Scattering models are applied for fitting of the exptl. SAXS patterns and identification of the structural changes in the aq. and lipid bilayer subcompartments.  The possibility of transforming, at ambient temp. (20°), the bicontinuous cubic nanostructures into inverted hexagonal (HII) or sponge (L3) mesophases may facilitate novel biomedical applications of the investigated liq. cryst. self-assemblies.\n",

      "A review.  Nanostructure bicontinuous cubic phase self-assembled materials are receiving expanding applications as biocompatible delivery systems in various therapeutic fields.  The functionalization of cubosome, spongosome, hexosome and liposome nanocarriers by pH-sensitive lipids and/or pH-sensitive polymer shells offers new opportunities for oral and topical drug delivery towards a new generation of cancer therapies.  The electrochem. behavior of drug compds. may favor pH-triggered drug release as well.  Here, we highlight recent investigations, which explore the phase behavior of mixed nonlamellar lipid/fatty acid or phospholipid systems for the design of pH-responsive and mucoadhesive drug delivery systems with sustained-release properties.  X-ray diffraction and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques are widely used in the development of innovative delivery assemblies through detailed structural analyses of multiple amphiphilic compns. from the lipid/co-lipid/water phase diagrams.  A pH-responsive nanoscale materials and nanoparticles are required for challenging therapeutic applications such as oral delivery of therapeutic proteins and peptides as well as of poorly water-sol. substances.  Perspective nanomedicine developments with smart cubosome nanocarriers may exploit compns. elaborated to overcome the intestinal obstacles, dual-drug loaded pH-sensitive liq. cryst. architectures aiming at enhanced therapeutic efficacy, as well as composite (lipid/polyelectrolyte) types of mucoadhesive controlled release colloidal cubosomal formulations for the improvement of the drugs' bioavailability.\n",

      "The structure of colloidal self-assembled drug delivery systems can be influenced by intermol. interactions between drug and amphiphilic mols., and is important to understand in the context of designing improved delivery systems.  Controlling these structures can enable controlled or targeted release systems for poorly water-sol. drugs.  Here we present the interaction of the hydrophobic vasoactive drug nicergoline with the internal structure of nanostructured emulsion particles based on the monoglyceride-water system.  Addn. of this drug leads to modification of the internal bicontinuous cubic structure to generate highly pH-responsive systems.  The colloidal structures were characterized with small-angle X-ray scattering and visualized using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.  Reversible transformations to inverse micelles at high pH, vesicles at low pH, and the modification of the spacing of the bicontinuous cubic structure at intermediate pH were obsd., and enabled the in situ detn. of an apparent pKa for the drug in this system-a difficult task using soln.-based approaches.  The characterization of this phase behavior is also highly interesting for the design of pH-responsive controlled release systems for poorly water-sol. drug mols.\n",

      "Studies of nonequil. lipid polymorphism at the nanoscale contribute to the in-depth understanding of the structural pathways for formation of aq. channels and emerging of channels-network ordering in liq.-cryst. (LC) nanovehicles.  The authors present exptl. structural evidence for the smallest tetrahedral-type lipid membrane aggregate, which involves completely formed nanochannels and occurs as an early intermediate state during the bilayer vesicle-to-cubosome particle transition.  Nanovehicles are generated from a self-assembled lipid mixt. and studied by high-resoln. cryogenic TEM (cryo-TEM) and synchrotron radiation small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS).  The studied lipid membrane compn. allows for the stabilization of long-lived intermediates throughout the unilamellar vesicle-to-cubosome nanoparticle (NP) transformation at ambient temp.  The obsd. small cubosomic particles, with well-defined H2O channels, appear to be precursors of larger cubic membrane structures, thus confirming the theor. modeling of nanochannel-network growth in diamond-type cubic lipid particles.  The reported structural findings, highlighting that bilayer vesicle membrane packing and fusion are required for nanochanneled cubosome particle formation, are anticipated to advance the engineering of small lipid NPs with controllable channels for biomol. loading and release.\n",

We highlight how recent developments in iron oxide nanoparticle design and understanding of nanoparticle membrane interactions have led to applications in magnetically triggered, liposome delivery vehicles with controlled structure.  Nanoscale vesicles actuated by incorporated nanoparticles allow for controlling location and timing of compd. release, which enables e.g. use of more potent drugs in drug delivery as the interaction with the right target is ensured.  This review emphasizes recent results on the connection between nanoparticle design, vesicle assembly and the stability and release properties of the vesicles.

      "BACKGROUND:  Nanoparticle imaging and tracking the release of the loaded material from the nanoparticle system have attracted significant attention in recent years.  If the release of the loaded molecules could be monitored reliably in vivo, it would speed up the development of drug delivery systems remarkably.  METHODS:  Here, we test a system that uses indocyanine green (ICG) as a fluorescent agent for studying release kinetics in vitro and in vivo from the lipid iron nanoparticle delivery system.  The ICG spectral properties like its concentration dependence, sensitivity and the fluctuation of the absorption and emission wavelengths can be utilized for gathering information about the change of the ICG surrounding.  RESULTS:  We have found that the absorption, fluorescence, and photoacoustic spectra of ICG in lipid iron nanoparticles differ from the spectra of ICG in pure water and plasma.  We followed the ICG containing liposomal nanoparticle uptake into squamous carcinoma cells (SCC) by fluorescence microscopy and the in vivo uptake into SCC tumors in an orthotopic xenograft nude mouse model under a surgical microscope.  CONCLUSION:  Absorption and emission properties of ICG in the different solvent environment, like in plasma and human serum albumin, differ from those in aqueous solution.  Photoacoustic spectral imaging confirmed a peak shift towards longer wavelengths and an intensity increase of ICG when bound to the lipids.  The SCC cells showed that the ICG containing liposomes bind to the cell surface but are not internalized in the SCC-9 cells after 60 minutes of incubation.  We also showed here that ICG containing liposomal nanoparticles can be traced under a surgical camera in vivo in orthotopic SCC xenografts in mice.\n",

      "A review.  In recent years, much progress has been motivated in stimuli-responsive nanocarriers, which could response to the intrinsic physicochem. and pathol. factors in diseased regions to increase the specificity of drug delivery.  Currently, numerous nanocarriers have been engineered with physicochem. changes in responding to external stimuli, such as ultrasound, thermal, light and magnetic field, as well as internal stimuli, including pH, redox potential, hypoxia and enzyme, etc.  Nanocarriers could respond to stimuli in tumor microenvironments or inside cancer cells for on-demanded drug delivery and accumulation, controlled drug release, activation of bioactive compds., probes and targeting ligands, as well as size, charge and conformation conversion, etc. leading to sensing and signaling, overcoming multidrug resistance, accurate diagnosis and precision therapy.  This review has summarized the general strategies of developing stimuli-responsive nanocarriers and recent advances, presented their applications in drug delivery, tumor imaging, therapy and theranostics, illustrated the progress of clin. translation and made prospects.\n",

      "Multiphoton imaging techniques that convert low-energy excitation to higher energy emission are widely used to improve signal over background, reduce scatter, and limit photodamage.  Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are among the most efficient multiphoton probes, but even UCNPs with optimized lanthanide dopant levels require laser intensities that may be problematic.  Here, we develop protein-sized, alloyed UCNPs (aUCNPs) that can be imaged individually at laser intensities >300-fold lower than needed for comparably sized doped UCNPs.  Using single UCNP characterization and kinetic modeling, we find that addition of inert shells changes optimal lanthanide content from Yb(3+), Er(3+)-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals to fully alloyed compositions.  At high levels, emitter Er(3+) ions can adopt a second role to enhance aUCNP absorption cross-section by desaturating sensitizer Yb(3+) or by absorbing photons directly.  Core/shell aUCNPs 12 nm in total diameter can be imaged through deep tissue in live mice using a laser intensity of 0.1 W cm(-2).\n",

      "Near IR (NIR) microscopy enables noninvasive imaging in tissue, particularly in the NIR-II spectral range (1000-1400 nm) where attenuation due to tissue scattering and absorption is minimized.  Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanocrystals are promising deep-tissue imaging probes due to their photostable emission in the visible and NIR, but these materials are not efficiently excited at NIR-II wavelengths due to the dearth of lanthanide ground-state absorption transitions in this window.  Here, the authors develop a class of lanthanide-doped imaging probes that harness an energy-looping mechanism that facilitates excitation at NIR-II wavelengths, such as 1064 nm, that are resonant with excited-state absorption transitions but not ground-state absorption.  Using computational methods and combinatorial screening, the authors have identified Tm3+-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles as efficient looping systems that emit at 800 nm under continuous-wave excitation at 1064 nm.  Using this benign excitation with std. confocal microscopy, energy-looping nanoparticles (ELNPs) are imaged in cultured mammalian cells and through brain tissue without autofluorescence.  The 1 mm imaging depths and 2 μm feature sizes are comparable to those demonstrated by state-of-the-art multiphoton techniques, illustrating that ELNPs are a promising class of NIR probes for high-fidelity visualization in cells and tissue.\n",

      "The major challenge in current chemotherapy is to increase local effective therapeutic concn. of drugs as well as to minimize toxicity and side effects for patients.  The targeted delivery of drugs to their desired site of action in a controlled manner plays an essential role in the development of drug formulations.  A photocage refers to a caged mol. rendered biol. inert by a photolabile protecting group.  Mols. are illuminated with light to liberate the caged group and then become active forms.  In this study, we formulate upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as the NIR-triggered targeting and drug delivery vehicles that successfully deliver in vitro and in vivo for near-IR light photocontrolled targeting, bioimaging, and chemotherapy.  It is noted that there has been no report on the systemic administration UCNP-based drug delivery agents for evaluation of bioimaging and chemotherapy.  To achieve phototargeting, the tumor-homing agent (i.e., folic acid) has been constructed as a photoresponsive mol.  For the chemotherapeutic effect, the antitumor drug doxorubicin is thiolated on the surface of UCNPs, forming a disulfide bond that can be cleaved by lysosomal enzymes within the cells.  The caged UNCPs can serve as a platform for the improvement of selective targeting and possible redn. of adverse side effects from chemotherapy.\n",

      "Efficient control over drug release is crit. to increasing drug efficacy and avoiding side effects.  An ideal drug delivery system would deliver drugs in the right amt., at the right location and at the right time noninvasively.  This can be achieved using light-triggered delivery: light is noninvasive, spatially precise and safe if appropriate wavelengths are chosen.  However, the use of light-controlled delivery systems has been limited to areas that are not too deep inside the body because UV or visible (Vis) light, the typical wavelengths used for photoreactions, have limited penetration and are toxic to biol. tissues.  The advent of upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) has made it possible to overcome this crucial challenge.  UCNPs can convert near-IR (NIR) radiation, which can penetrate deeper inside the body, to shorter wavelength NIR, Vis and UV radiation.  UCNPs have been used as bright, in situ sources of light for on-demand drug release and bioimaging applications.  These remote-controlled, NIR-triggered drug delivery systems are esp. attractive in applications where a drug is required at a specific location and time such as in anesthetics, postwound healing, cardiothoracic surgery and cancer treatment.  In this Perspective, we discuss recent progress and challenges as well as propose potential solns. and future directions, esp. with regard to their translation to the clinic.\n",

      "Stimuli-responsive drug delivery vehicles have garnered immense interest in recent years due to unparalleled progress made in material science and nanomedicine.  However, the development of stimuli-responsive devices with integrated real-time monitoring capabilities is still in its nascent stage because of the limitations of imaging modalities.  In this paper, we describe the development of a polypeptide-wrapped mesoporous-silica-coated multicolor upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP@MSN) as an ATP-responsive drug delivery system (DDS) for long-term tracking and real-time monitoring of drug release.  Our UCNP@MSN with multiple emission peaks in UV-NIR wavelength range was functionalized with zinc-dipicolylamine analog (TDPA-Zn2+) on its exterior surface and loaded with small-mol. drugs like chemotherapeutics in interior mesopores.  The drugs remained entrapped within the UCNP-MSNs when the nanoparticles were wrapped with a compact branched polypeptide, poly(Asp-Lys)-b-Asp, because of multivalent interactions between Asp moieties present in the polypeptide and the TDPA-Zn2+ complex present on the surface of UCNP-MSNs.  This led to luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) from the UCNPs to the entrapped drugs, which typically have absorption in UV-visible range, ultimately resulting in quenching of UCNP emission in UV-visible range while retaining their strong NIR emission.  Addn. of ATP led to a competitive displacement of the surface bound polypeptide by ATP due to its higher affinity to TDPA-Zn2+, which led to the release of the entrapped drugs and subsequent elimination of LRET.  Monitoring of such ATP-triggered ratiometric changes in LRET allowed us to monitor the release of the entrapped drugs in real-time.  Given these results, we envision that our proposed UCNP@MSN-polypeptide hybrid nanoparticle has great potential for stimuli-responsive drug delivery as well as for monitoring biochem. changes taking place in live cancer and stem cells.\n",

      "The authors report the first real-time tracking study with upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) at the single vesicle level in living cells.  Thanks to the remarkable photostability of UCNPs and the noninvasiveness of NIR excitation, the authors were able to visualize the intracellular movements of UCNPs for as long as 6 h without interruption.  The authors first assessed the benefits of using near-IR radiation as the excitation source to demonstrate the feasibility of long-term live-cell imaging with UCNPs.  The UCNPs (hexagonal phase NaYF4 codoped with Yb3+ and Er3+, ∼30 nm in diam.) coated by amphiphilic PEG-phospholipids were internalized into HeLa cells and imaged on a homemade epifluorescence microscope setup.  The dynamics of particle transport was composed of multiple phases within a single trajectory including the active transport by motor proteins such as dyneins and kinesins.  Further improvement in the optical upconversion efficiency and surface conjugation schemes will make UCNPs more versatile nanoparticle-based biolabels for intracellular proteins and organelles, accelerating diagnostic and therapeutic applications thereof.\n",

      "The development of probes for single-mol. imaging has dramatically facilitated the study of individual mols. in cells and other complex environments.  Single-mol. probes ideally exhibit good brightness, uninterrupted emission, resistance to photobleaching, and minimal spectral overlap with cellular autofluorescence.  However, most single-mol. probes are imperfect in several of these aspects, and none have been shown to possess all of these characteristics.  Here the authors show that individual lanthanide-doped up-converting nanoparticles (UCNPs) - specifically, hexagonal phase NaYF4 (β-NaYF4) nanocrystals with multiple Yb3+ and Er3+ dopants - emit bright anti-Stokes visible up-converted luminescence with exceptional photostability when excited by a 980-nm continuous wave laser.  Individual UCNPs exhibit no on/off emission behavior, or \"blinking,\" down to the millisecond time-scale, and no loss of intensity following an hour of continuous excitation.  Amphiphilic polymer coatings permit the transfer of hydrophobic UCNPs into water, resulting in individual water-sol. nanoparticles with undiminished photophys. characteristics.  These UCNPs are endocytosed by cells and show strong up-converted luminescence, with no measurable anti-Stokes background autofluorescence, suggesting that UCNPs are ideally suited for single-mol. imaging expts.\n",

      "Acquiring the temp. of a single living cell is not a trivial task.  In this paper, the authors devise a novel nanothermometer, capable of accurately detg. the temp. of solns. as well as biol. systems such as HeLa cancer cells.  The nanothermometer is based on the temp.-sensitive fluorescence of NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles, where the intensity ratio of the green fluorescence bands of the Er3+ dopant ions (2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) changes with temp.  The nanothermometers were first used to obtain thermal profiles created when heating a colloidal soln. of NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles in water using a pump-probe expt.  Following incubation of the nanoparticles with HeLa cervical cancer cells and their subsequent uptake, the fluorescent nanothermometers measured the internal temp. of the living cell from 25° to its thermally induced death at 45°.\n",

      "Advanced diagnostic procedures are required to satisfy the continuously increasing demands of modern biomedicine while also addressing the need for cost redn. in public health systems.  The development of IR luminescence-based techniques for in vivo imaging as reliable alternatives to traditional imaging enables applications with simpler and more cost-effective app.  To further improve the information provided by in vivo luminescence images, the design and fabrication of enhanced IR-luminescent contrast agents is required.  In this work, the authors demonstrate how simple dopant engineering can lead to IR-emitting rare-earth-doped nanoparticles with tunable (0.1-1.5 ms) and medium-independent luminescence lifetimes.  The combination of these tunable nanostructures with time-gated IR imaging and time domain anal. is employed to obtain multiplexed in vivo images that are used for complex biodistribution studies.\n",

      "Mech. forces affect a myriad of processes, from bone growth to material fracture to touch-responsive robotics.  While nano- to micro-Newton forces are prevalent at the microscopic scale, few methods have the nanoscopic size and signal stability to measure them in vivo or in situ.  Here, the authors develop an optical force-sensing platform based on sub-25 nm NaYF4 nanoparticles (NPs) doped with Yb3+, Er3+, and Mn2+.  The lanthanides Yb3+ and Er3+ enable both photoluminescence and upconversion, while the energetically coupled d-metal Mn2+ adds force tunability through its crystal field sensitivity.  Using a diamond anvil cell to exert up to 3.5 GPa pressure or ∼10 μN force per particle, the authors track stress-induced spectral responses.  The red (660 nm) to green (520, 540 nm) emission ratio varies linearly with pressure, yielding an obsd. color change from orange to red for α-NaYF4 and from yellow-green to green for d-metal optimized β-NaYF4 when illuminated in the near IR.  Consistent readouts are recorded over multiple pressure cycles and hours of illumination.  With the nanoscopic size, a dynamic range of 100 nN to 10 μN, and photostability, these nanoparticles lay the foundation for visualizing dynamic mech. processes, such as stress propagation in materials and force signaling in organisms.\n",

      "Mammals cannot see light over 700 nm in wavelength.  This limitation is due to the phys. thermodn. properties of the photon-detecting opsins.  However, the detection of naturally invisible near-IR (NIR) light is a desirable ability.  To break this limitation, we developed ocular injectable photoreceptor-binding upconversion nanoparticles (pbUCNPs).  These nanoparticles anchored on retinal photoreceptors as miniature NIR light transducers to create NIR light image vision with negligible side effects.  Based on single-photoreceptor recordings, electroretinograms, cortical recordings, and visual behavioral tests, we demonstrated that mice with these nanoantennae could not only perceive NIR light, but also see NIR light patterns.  Excitingly, the injected mice were also able to differentiate sophisticated NIR shape patterns.  Moreover, the NIR light pattern vision was ambient-daylight compatible and existed in parallel with native daylight vision.  This new method will provide unmatched opportunities for a wide variety of emerging bio-integrated nanodevice designs and applications.\n",

      "Optogenetics has revolutionized the exptl. interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurol. disorders.  It is limited, however, because visible light cannot penetrate deep inside brain tissue.  Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-IR (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific visible light.  Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep brain neurons.  Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged neurons in the ventral tegmental area, induced brain oscillations through activation of inhibitory neurons in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall.  UCNP technol. will enable less-invasive optical neuronal activity manipulation with the potential for remote therapy.\n",

      "Functionalization of nanocrystals is essential for their practical application, but synthesis on nanocrystal surfaces is limited by incompatibilities with certain key reagents.  The copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddn. is among the most useful methods for ligating mols. to surfaces, but has been largely useless for semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) because Cu+ ions quickly and irreversibly quench QD fluorescence.  To discover nonquenching synthetic conditions for Cu-catalyzed click reactions on QD surfaces, we developed a combinatorial fluorescence assay to screen >2000 reaction conditions to maximize cycloaddn. efficiency while minimizing QD quenching.  We identify conditions for complete coupling without significant quenching, which are compatible with common QD polymer surfaces and various azide/alkyne pairs.  Based on insight from the combinatorial screen and mechanistic studies of Cu coordination and quenching, we find that superstoichiometric concns. of Cu can promote full coupling if accompanied by ligands that selectively compete with the Cu from the QD surface but allow it to remain catalytically active.  Applied to the conjugation of a K+ channel-specific peptidyl toxin to CdSe/ZnS QDs, we synthesize unquenched QD conjugates and image their specific and voltage-dependent affinity for K+ channels in live cells.\n",

      "Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have demonstrated utility in long-term single particle tracking of membrane proteins in live cells in culture.  To extend the superior optical properties of QDs to more physiol. relevant cell platforms, such as acute brain slices, we examine the photophysics of compact ligand-conjugated CdSe/CdS QDs using both ensemble and single particle anal. in brain tissue media.  We find that sym. core passivation is crit. for both photostability in oxygenated media and for prolonged single particle imaging in brain slices.  We then demonstrate the utility of these QDs by imaging single dopamine transporters in acute brain slices, achieving 20 nm localization precision at 10 Hz frame rates.  These findings detail design requirements needed for new QD probes in complex living environments, and open the door to physiol. relevant studies that capture the utility of QD probes in acute brain slices.\n",

      "Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) proved to be superior probes for single-mol. imaging compared to org. or genetically encoded fluorophores, but they are limited by difficulties in protein targeting, their larger size, and on-off blinking.  Here, the authors report compact aq. CdSe/CdS QDs with significantly improved bioconjugation efficiency and superior single-mol. optical properties.  The authors synthesized covalent protein labeling ligands (i.e., SNAP tags) that are optimized for nanoparticle use, and QDs functionalized with these ligands label SNAP-tagged proteins ∼10-fold more efficiently than existing SNAP ligands.  Single-mol. anal. of these QDs shows 99% of time spent in the fluorescent on-state, ∼4-fold higher quantum efficiency than std. CdSe/ZnS QDs, and 350 million photons detected before photobleaching.  Bright signals of these QDs enable the authors to track the stepping movement of a kinesin motor in vitro, and the improved labeling efficiency enables tracking of single kinesins in live cells.\n",

      "We have presented a new modular approach for the immobilization on nanoparticles of peptide ligands selective for targeting specific cancer cells.  This method is based on the genetic encoding of the targeting protein, here an scFv antibody variant, which was produced in N-terminal-linked fusion with SNAP.  SNAP-scFv reacted quickly, efficiently, and in a site-directed manner with a 06-PEG-guanine deriv. anchored onto the nanoparticle surface, which resulted in the formation of a new covalent bond between the scFv and the nanocomplex with release of a guanine mol.  The potential of this strategy for nanoparticle bioengineering was demonstrated using an anti-HER2 scFv antibody that was immobilized on multifunctional nanoparticles, which proved very selective in targeting HER2 antigen in breast cancer cells.  As the polymer utilized in this study can be exploited for transporting various kinds of nanoparticles to water phase,I29I this approach can be considered of general value for the development of targeted nanoparticles for biomedical applications.\n",

      "A review.  Nanoparticles modified with ligands for specific targeting towards receptors expressed on the surface of target cells are discussed in literature towards improved delivery strategies.  In such concepts the ligand d. on the surface of the nanoparticles plays an important role.  How many ligands per nanoparticle are best for the most efficient delivery.  Importantly, this no. may be different for in vitro and in vivo scenarios.  In this review first viruses as \"biol.\" nanoparticles are analyzed towards their ligand d., which is then compared to the ligand d. of engineered nanoparticles.  Then, expts. are reviewed in which in vitro and in vivo nanoparticle delivery has been analyzed in terms of ligand d.  These results help to understand which ligand densities should be attempted for better targeting.  Finally synthetic methods for controlling the ligand d. of nanoparticles are described.\n",

      "For imaging with different modalities, labels, which provide contrast for all modalities, are required.  Colloidal nanoparticles composed out of an inorg. core and a polymer shell offer progress in this direction.  Both, the core and the polymer shell, can be synthesized to be fluorescent, magnetic, or radioactive.  When different cores are combined with different polymer shells, different types of particles for dual imaging can be obtained, as for example, fluorescent cores with radioactive polymer shells.  Properties and perspectives of such nanoparticles for multimodal imaging are discussed.\n",

      "A review.  Radiometals comprise many useful radioactive isotopes of various metallic elements.  When properly harnessed, these have valuable emission properties that can be used for diagnostic imaging techniques, such as single photon emission computed tomog. (SPECT, e.g.67Ga, 99mTc, 111In, 177Lu) and positron emission tomog. (PET, e.g.68Ga, 64Cu, 44Sc, 86Y, 89Zr), as well as therapeutic applications (e.g.47Sc, 114mIn, 177Lu, 90Y, 212/213Bi, 212Pb, 225Ac, 186/188Re).  A fundamental crit. component of a radiometal-based radiopharmaceutical is the chelator, the ligand system that binds the radiometal ion in a tight stable coordination complex so that it can be properly directed to a desirable mol. target in vivo.  This article is a guide for selecting the optimal match between chelator and radiometal for use in these systems.  The article briefly introduces a selection of relevant and high impact radiometals, and their potential utility to the fields of radiochem., nuclear medicine, and mol. imaging.  A description of radiometal-based radiopharmaceuticals is provided, and several key design considerations are discussed.  The exptl. methods by which chelators are assessed for their suitability with a variety of radiometal ions is explained, and a large selection of the most common and most promising chelators are evaluated and discussed for their potential use with a variety of radiometals.  Comprehensive tables have been assembled to provide a convenient and accessible overview of the field of radiometal chelating agents.\n",

      "The development of novel prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted, radioactive theranostic agents is currently limited to facilities capable of working with high-energy radioisotopes.  Even preselection of lead structures in vitro relies mostly on radioactive assays with PSMA(+) LNCaP and PSMA(-) PC-3 cells.  Assays utilizing radioisotopes are time consuming, costly, and limit discovery to a small group of scientists with special facilities.  Nonradioactive alternatives are therefore needed in the field.  In this paper the authors describe an inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)-based method for the evaluation of PSMA-targeting ligands conjugated to DOTA-chelates of Europium.  The method is based on LNCaP and PC-3 cells and has been validated with the well-established targeting ligand PSMA-617.\n",

      "A review.  Tens of millions of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams are performed annually around the world.  The contrast agents, which improve diagnostic accuracy, are almost exclusively small, hydrophilic gadolinium(III) based chelates.  In recent years concerns have arisen surrounding the long-term safety of these compds., and this has spurred research into alternatives.  There has also been a push to develop new molecularly targeted contrast agents or agents that can sense pathol. changes in the local environment.  This comprehensive review describes the state of the art of clin. approved contrast agents, their mechanism of action, and factors influencing their safety.  From there we describe different mechanisms of generating MR image contrast such as relaxation, chem. exchange satn. transfer, and direct detection and the types of mols. that are effective for these purposes.  Next we describe efforts to make safer contrast agents either by increasing relaxivity, increasing resistance to metal ion release, or by moving to gadolinium(III)-free alternatives.  Finally we survey approaches to make contrast agents more specific for pathol. either by direct biochem. targeting or by the design of responsive or activatable contrast agents.\n",

      "The development of fluorophores and mol. probes for the second near-IR biol. window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) represents an important, newly emerging and dynamic field in mol. imaging, chem. biol. and materials chem.  Because of reduced scattering, minimal absorption and negligible autofluorescence, NIR-II imaging provides high resoln., a high signal-to-noise ratio, and deep tissue penetration capability.  Among various state-of-the-art bioimaging modalities, one of the greatest challenges in developing novel probes is to achieve both high resoln. and sensitivity.  The chem. design and synthesis of NIR-II fluorophores suitable for multimodal imaging is thus emerging as a new and powerful strategy for obtaining high-definition images.  NIR-II fluorophores may convert NIR-II photons into heat for photothermal therapy and be excited by NIR-II light to produce singlet oxygen for photodynamic therapy.  The presence of simultaneous diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities in a single probe can be used for precise treatment.  In this review, we have focused on recent advances in the chem. design and synthesis of NIR-II fluorophores from small org. mols. to org. and inorg. nanoparticles, and we have further discussed recent advances and key operational differences in reported NIR-II imaging systems and biomedical applications based on NIR-II imaging, such as multimodal imaging, photothermal and photodynamic therapy, guidance for intraoperative surgery, and drug delivery.\n",

      "With the rising use of nanomaterials in everyday objects, an uptake of those materials by humans is very likely.  To assess their effect on the body, reliable detection of nanoparticles even in very low amts. in human blood becomes increasingly important.  Single-particle (SP) inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a fast and reliable method for counting and sizing particles at lowest concns., while simultaneously distinguishing between dissolved and particulate analytes.  For the first time to the authors' knowledge, a dedicated method validation approach for silver and gold nanoparticle anal. in human whole blood has been performed.  With only a little sample prepn., trueness expressed as bias with values below or equal to 5% and imprecision values <6% for particle size as well as an effective limit of detection of ∼20 nm are possible.  The concn. working range throughout all measured samples was in the nanogram per L range, making SP-ICP-MS a powerful tool in future nanotoxicol. applications and trace anal. of nanoparticles.\n",

      "To study pharmacokinetic properties of puerarin poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimer complex, a sensitive liq. chromatog. tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) was developed and validated to det. puerarin in rabbit aq. humor using microdialysis sampling.  Astilbin was used as the internal std.  The linear range for puerarin was from 2 to 1000 ng/mL (r = 0.9986) based on 20 μL of aq. humor.  The coeffs. of variations for intra-day and inter-day precisions were less than 10.0%, and the relative error of accuracy was within ±6.3%.  The mean extn. recovery of puerarin varied from 80.4% to 85.5%.  Microdialysis provides a complete concn. vs. time profile.  A significant difference was obsd. in main pharmacokinetic parameters of Cmax, AUC and t1/2 between puerarin soln. and puerarin PAMAM dendrimer complex.  Complex formation resulted in an obvious increase in bioavailability of puerarin after topical administration to rabbit according to the above LC-MS/MS assay method.\n",

      "A sensitive and specific liq. chromatog./mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantification of the modified γ-cyclodextrin Org 25969 and rocuronium bromide (Org 9426) in the plasma and urine of guinea pigs.  The assay was linear and reproducible over the range 25-10000 ng/mL for both compds.  The lowest limit of quantification (LLOQ) for both compds. in urine was 25 ng/mL.  In plasma, the LLOQ was 25 ng/mL for Org 9426 and 50 ng/mL for Org 25969.  The inter- and intraday variations were <20%.  The physicochem. properties of both compds. imposed different modes of extn. from plasma.  The modified γ-cyclodextrin was extd. by trifluoroacetic acid, pptn. while rocuronium was extd. by MeCN pptn.  Both compds. were quantified in urine by direct injection onto the column.  The LC/MS analyses of Org 25969 and Org 9426 were performed by using two different assay conditions.  It was not possible to quantify the complex of cyclodextrin and rocuronium, as it dissocd. on the LC column.  The use of LC/MS conferred great advantage to the quantification of both Org 25969 and Org 9426, as they are not chromogenic enough to afford the sensitivity and specificity required for the assay.\n",

      "The fate of polymer-coated Eu- and Bi-doped GdVO4 nanoparticles (NPs) of cubic shape upon cellular internalization was investigated.  After having been endocytosed by cells, the cubic Eu- and Bi-doped GdVO4 NP cores were partly dissolved and reshaped to rounded structures, which in control expts. could be ascribed to the acidic conditions present in endosomes/lysosomes.  With progress of time, there was a significant redn. in the amt. of internalized NPs per cell due to proliferation.  This was of higher extent than NP exocytosis.  Data of the study are compatible with the scenario that endosomal/lysosomal enzymes may partly digest the polymer shell around the NP cores, with enhanced exocytosis of the polymer fragments as compared to the NP cores.\n",

      "The transport and the delivery of drugs through nanocarriers is a great challenge of pharmacol.  Since the prodn. of liposomes to reduce the toxicity of doxorubicin in patients, a plethora of nanomaterials have been produced and characterized.  Although it is widely known that elementary properties of nanomaterials influence their in vivo kinetics, such interaction is often poorly investigated in many preclin. studies.  The present study aims to evaluate the actual effect of size and shape on the biodistribution of a set of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) after i.v. administration in mice.  To this goal, quant. data achieved by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and observational results emerging from histochem. (autometallog. and enhanced dark-field hyperspectral microscopy) were combined.  Since the immune system plays a role in bionano-interaction we used healthy immune-competent mice.  To keep the immune surveillance on the physiol. levels we synthesized endotoxin-free GNPs to be tested in specific pathogen-free animals.  Our study mainly reveals that (a) the size and the shape greatly influence the kinetics of accumulation and excretion of GNPs in filter organs; (b) spherical and star-like GNPs showed the same percentage of accumulation, but a different localization in liver; (c) only star-like GNPs are able to accumulate in lung; (d) changes in the geometry did not improve the passage of the blood brain barrier.  Overall, this study can be considered as a reliable starting point to drive the synthesis and the functionalization of potential candidates for theranostic purposes in many fields of research.\n",

      "The physicochem. properties of a set of 21 different gold nanoparticles (spherical and rod-shaped nanoparticles (NPs) of different diams. with three different surface coatings) were studied.  Protein corona formation, in vitro uptake, effect on cell viability and proliferation, and in vivo biodistribution of these NPs were detd.  The relation of the results of the different NPs was analyzed by hierarchical cluster anal., which will tell which NPs have the most similar physicochem. properties and biol. effects, without having to specify individual physicochem. parameters.  The results show that the physicochem. properties of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are mainly accounted for by their hydrodynamic diam. and their zeta-potential.  The formation of the protein corona is detd. by the pH-dependence of their zeta-potential.  While several reports found that in vitro uptake and in vivo biodistribution of NPs are correlated to individual physicochem. parameters, e.g., size, shape, or surface chem., such direct dependence in the investigated multidimensional set of NPs was not found in our study.  This most likely is due to entanglement of the different parameters, which complicates the prediction of the biol. effect of NPs in case multiple physicochem. properties are simultaneously varied.  The in vitro uptake and in vivo biodistribution of NPs seem to be not directly driven by the protein corona, but the physicochem. properties det. as well the corona as they influence in vitro/in vivo behaviors, and thus the effect of the protein corona would be rather indirect.\n",

      "Posttranslational modifications and proteolytic processing regulate almost all physiol. processes.  Dysregulation can potentially result in pathol. protein species causing diseases.  Thus, tissue species proteomes of diseased individuals provide diagnostic information.  Since the compn. of tissue proteomes can rapidly change during tissue homogenization by the action of enzymes released from their compartments, disease specific protein species patterns can vanish.  Recently, we described a novel, ultrafast and soft method for cold vaporization of tissue via desorption by impulsive vibrational excitation (DIVE) using a picosecond-IR-laser (PIRL).  Given that DIVE extn. may provide improved access to the original compn. of protein species in tissues, we compared the proteome compn. of tissue protein homogenates after DIVE homogenization with conventional homogenizations.  A higher no. of intact protein species was obsd. in DIVE homogenates.  Due to the ultrafast transfer of proteins from tissues via gas phase into frozen condensates of the aerosols, intact protein species were exposed to a lesser extent to enzymic degrdn. reactions compared with conventional protein extn.  In addn., total yield of the no. of proteins is higher in DIVE homogenates, because they are very homogenous and contain almost no insol. particles, allowing direct anal. with subsequent anal. methods without the necessity of centrifugation.  Enzymic protein modifications during tissue homogenization are responsible for changes of the in-vivo protein species compn.  Cold vaporization of tissues by PIRL-DIVE is comparable with taking a snapshot at the time of the laser irradn. of the dynamic changes that occur continuously under in-vivo conditions.  At that time point all biomols. are transferred into an aerosol, which is immediately frozen.\n",

      "Mass spectrometry (MS) imaging is a versatile method to analyze the spatial distribution of analytes in tissue sections.  It provides unique features for the analysis of drug compounds in pharmacokinetic studies such as label-free detection and differentiation of compounds and metabolites.  We have recently introduced a MS imaging method that combines high mass resolution and high spatial resolution in a single experiment, hence termed HR(2) MS imaging.  In the present study, we applied this method to analyze the spatial distribution of the anti-cancer drugs imatinib and ifosfamide in individual mouse organs.  The whole kidney of an animal dosed with imatinib was measured at 35 μm spatial resolution.  Imatinib showed a well-defined distribution in the outer stripe of the outer medulla.  This area was analyzed in more detail at 10 μm step size, which constitutes a tenfold increase in effective spatial resolution compared to previous studies of drug compounds.  In parallel, ion images of phospholipids and heme were used to characterize the histological features of the tissue section and showed excellent agreement with histological staining of the kidney after MS imaging.  Ifosfamide was analyzed in mouse kidney at 20 μm step size and was found to be accumulated in the inner medulla region.  The identity of imatinib and ifosfamide was confirmed by on-tissue MS/MS measurements.  All measurements including mass spectra from 10 μm pixels featured accurate mass (≤2 ppm root mean square) and mass resolving power of R = 30,000.  Selected ion images were generated with a bin size of αm/z = 0.01 ensuring highly specific information.  The ability of the method to cover larger areas was demonstrated by imaging a compound in the intestinal tract of a rat whole-body tissue section at 200 μm step size.  The described method represents a major improvement in terms of spatial resolution and specificity for the analysis of drug compounds in tissue sections.\n",

      "Cancer-cell heterogeneity dramatically influences treatment success, but escapes detection by classical histol.  Mass-spectrometric imaging (MSI) represents a powerful method for visualizing the spatial distribution of proteins in tissue sections.  Herein we asked whether MSI also facilitates detection of tumor heterogeneity.  We first transduced the human neuroendocrine-carcinoma BON cell line following the red-green-blue (RGB) marking principle.  RGB marking allows for specific color-coding of individual clones.  Mice transplanted with RGB-marked BON cells developed liver tumors.  We identified 16 primary tumors clearly distinguishable by histol. and fluorescence imaging, but also based on a common tumor-specific signal pattern detected by MSI.  Importantly, this pattern was clearly confined to tumor tissue while was absent from surrounding liver tissue.  At the same time, we obsd. protein signals differentially present in a few or even single tumors.  Since these signals were independent of RGB marking, they apparently reflected unique intrinsic protein-signal patterns of individual tumors.  Thus, our data propose MSI as a tool for identifying divergent tissue by 'fingerprints' of protein signals, allowing not only for differentiation of tumor from healthy tissue but also detection of tumor heterogeneity.  In conclusion, by visualizing tumor heterogeneity, MSI ideally complements microscopy-based methods.  This might help to better understand tumor biol. and develop future treatment strategies.\n",

      "Plant vacuoles are dynamic organelles that play essential roles in regulating growth and development.  Two distinct models of vacuole biogenesis have been proposed: sep. vacuoles are formed by the fusion of endosomes, or the single interconnected vacuole is derived from the endoplasmic reticulum.  These two models are based on studies of two-dimensional (2D) transmission electron microscopy and 3D confocal imaging, resp.  Here, we performed 3D electron tomog. at nanometer resoln. to illustrate vacuole biogenesis in Arabidopsis root cells.  The whole-cell electron tomog. anal. first identified unique small vacuoles (SVs; 400-1,000 nm in diam.) as nascent vacuoles in early developmental cortical cells.  These SVs contained intraluminal vesicles and were mainly derived/matured from multivesicular body (MVB) fusion.  The whole-cell vacuole models and statistical anal. on wild-type root cells of different vacuole developmental stages demonstrated that central vacuoles were derived from MVB-to-SV transition and subsequent fusions of SVs.  Further electron tomog. anal. on mutants defective in MVB formation/maturation or vacuole fusion demonstrated that central vacuole formation required functional MVBs and membrane fusion machineries.\n",

      "Cryo-electron tomog. (cryoET) has become a powerful technique at the interface of structural biol. and cell biol., due to its unique ability for imaging cells in their native state and detg. structures of macromol. complexes in their cellular context.  A limitation of cryoET is its restriction to relatively thin samples.  Sample thinning by cryo-focused ion beam (cryoFIB) milling has significantly expanded the range of samples that can be analyzed by cryoET.  Unfortunately, cryoFIB milling is low-throughput, time-consuming and manual.  Here, we report a method for fully automated sequential cryoFIB prepn. of high-quality lamellae, including rough milling and polishing.  We reproducibly applied this method to eukaryotic and bacterial model organisms, and show that the resulting lamellae are suitable for cryoET imaging and subtomogram averaging.  Since our method reduces the time required for lamella prepn. and minimizes the need for user input, we envision the technique will render previously inaccessible projects feasible.\n",

      "Electron microscopy of biol. cells in liq. provides unique nanoscale information.  A highly attractive idea is the capability to also study physiol. processes of live cells with electron microscopy.  However, this idea seems unrealistic because the minimal needed electron dose to obtain contrast is already many orders of magnitude above the LD known to cause reproductive-cell death.  We show here that claims of electron microscopy of viable cells in recent reports are based on a questionable interpretation of the used fluorescence live/dead assay.  A practical alternative to study biol. processes is correlative light and electron microscopy.\n",

      "While nanoparticles are usually designed for targeted drug delivery, they can also simultaneously provide diagnostic information by a variety of in vivo imaging methods.  These diagnostic capabilities make use of specific properties of nanoparticle core materials.  Near-infrared fluorescent probes provide optical detection of cells targeted by real-time nanoparticle-distribution studies within the organ compartments of live, anesthetized animals.  By combining different imaging modalities, we can start with deep-body imaging by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, and by using optical imaging, get down to the resolution required for real-time fluorescence-guided surgery.\n",

      "Interactions between plants and the soil's microbial & fungal flora are crucial for the health of soil ecosystems and food prodn.  Microbe-plant interactions are difficult to investigate in situ due to their intertwined relationship involving morphol. and metab.  Here, we describe an approach to overcome this challenge by elucidating morphol. and the metabolic profile of Medicago truncatula root nodules using Magnetic Resonance (MR) Microscopy, at the highest magnetic field strength (22.3 T) currently available for imaging.  A home-built solenoid RF coil with an inner diam. of 1.5 mm was used to study individual root nodules.  A 3D imaging sequence with an isotropic resoln. of (7μm)3 was able to resolve individual cells, and distinguish between cells infected with rhizobia and uninfected cells.  Furthermore, we studied the metabolic profile of cells in different sections of the root nodule using localized MR spectroscopy and showed that several metabolites, including betaine, asparagine/aspartate and choline, have different concns. across nodule zones.  The metabolite spatial distribution was visualized using chem. shift imaging.  Finally, we describe the tech. challenges and outlook towards future in vivo MR microscopy of nodules and the plant root system.\n",

      "Recently, the first magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) images at the cellular level in isolated mammalian brain tissues were obtained using microsurface coils.  These methods can elucidate the cellular origins of MR signals and describe how these signals change over the course of disease progression and therapy.  In this work, we explore the capability of these microimaging techniques to visualize mouse muscle fibers and their nuclei.  Isolated myofibers expressing lacZ were imaged with and without a stain for β-galactosidase activity (S-Gal + ferric ammonium citrate) that produces both optical and MR contrast.  We found that MRM can be used to image single myofibers with 6-μm resoln.  The ability to image single myofibers will serve as a valuable tool to study MR properties attributed to healthy and myopathic cells.  The ability to image nuclei tagged with MR/Optical gene markers may also find wide use in cell lineage MRI studies.\n",

      "Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool which is well-suited to directly resolve cellular structures in ex vivo and in vitro tissues without use of exogenous contrast agents.  Recent advances in its capability to visualize mammalian cellular structure in intact tissues have reinvigorated analytical interest in aquatic cell models whose previous findings warrant up-to-date validation of subcellular components.  Even if the sensitivity of MRM is less than other microscopic technologies, its strength lies in that it relies on the same image contrast mechanisms as clinical MRI which make it a unique tool for improving our ability to interpret human diagnostic imaging through high resolution studies of well-controlled biological model systems.  Here, we investigate the subcellular MR signal characteristics of isolated cells of Aplysia californica at an in-plane resolution of 7.8 μm.  In addition, direct correlation and positive identification of subcellular architecture in the cells is achieved through well-established histology.  We hope this methodology will serve as the groundwork for studying pathophysiological changes through perturbation studies and allow for development of disease-specific cellular modeling tools.  Such an approach promises to reveal the MR contrast changes underlying cellular mechanisms in various human diseases, for example in ischemic stroke.\n",

      "The low efficiency of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is caused by tumor hypoxia and the adaptive immune resistance/evasion of tumor cells, while the currently emerging immune checkpoint therapy restores the intrinsic immune capacities but can't directly attack the tumor cells.  Herein we report an integrated nanoplatform that combines PDT with immunotherapy to enhance photodynamic therapeutic effects and simultaneously inhibit tumor cells resistance/evasion.  To achieve this, we fabricated Mn@CaCO3/ICG nanoparticles and loaded them with PD-L1-targeting siRNA.  Thanks to the protection of CaCO3 on the loaded ICG and the oxygen produced by MnO2, an enhanced photodynamic therapeutic effect in vitro was obsd.  In vivo expts. demonstrated that the nanoplatform could efficiently deliver the loaded drug to the tumor tissues and significantly improve tumor hypoxia, which further contributes to the therapeutic effect of PDT in vivo.  Moreover, the synergistic benefits derived from the siRNA, which silenced the checkpoint gene PD-L1 that mediates the immune resistance/evasion, resulted in a surprising therapeutic effect to rouse the immune system.  The combination treatment strategy has great potential to be developed as a new and robust method for enhanced PDT therapy with high efficiency and a powerful antitumor immune response based on PD-L1 blockade.\n",

      "A review.  Despite the comprehensive applications in bioimaging, biosensing, drug/gene delivery, and tumor therapy of manganese oxide nanomaterials (MONs including MnO2, MnO, Mn2O3, Mn3O4, and MnOx) and their derivs., a review article focusing on MON-based nanoplatforms has not been reported yet.  Herein, the representative progresses of MONs on synthesis, heterogene, properties, surface modification, toxicity, imaging, biodetection, and therapy are mainly introduced.  First, five kinds of primary synthetic methods of MONs are presented, including thermal decompn. method, exfoliation strategy, permanganates redn. method, adsorption-oxidn. method, and hydro/solvothermal.  Second, the prepns. of hollow MONs and MON-based composite materials are summarized specially.  Then, the chem. properties, surface modification, and toxicity of MONs are discussed.  Next, the diagnostic applications including imaging and sensing are outlined.  Finally, some representative rational designs of MONs in photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, chemodynamic therapy, sonodynamic therapy, radiotherapy, magnetic hyperthermia, chemotherapy, gene therapy, starvation therapy, ferroptosis, immunotherapy, and various combination therapy are highlighted.\n",

      "The recently emerged exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (ES-MIONs) (<5 nm) are promising T1-weighted contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to their good biocompatibility compared with Gd-chelates.  However, the best particle size of ES-MIONs for T1 imaging is still unknown because the synthesis of ES-MIONs with precise size control to clarify the relationship between the r1 (or r2/r1) and the particle size remains a challenge.  In this study, we synthesized ES-MIONs with seven different sizes below 5 nm and found that 3.6 nm is the best particle size for ES-MIONs to be utilized as T1-weighted MR contrast agent.  To enhance tumor targetability of theranostic nanoparticles and reduce the nonspecific uptake of nanoparticles by normal healthy cells, we constructed a drug delivery system based on the 3.6 nm ES-MIONs for T1-weighted tumor imaging and chemotherapy.  The laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and flow cytometry anal. results demonstrate that our strategy of precise targeting via exposure or hiding of the targeting ligand RGD2 on demand is feasible.  The MR imaging and chemotherapy results on the cancer cells and tumor-bearing mice reinforce that our DOX@ES-MION3@RGD2@mPEG3 nanoparticles are promising for high-resoln. T1-weighted MR imaging and precise chemotherapy of tumors.\n",

      "A review.  Advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of disease susceptibility coupled with prominent successes for mol. targeted therapies have resulted in an emerging strategy of personalized medicine.  This approach envisions risk stratification and therapeutic selection based on an individual's genetic makeup and physiol. state (the latter assessed through cellular or mol. phenotypes).  Molecularly targeted nanoparticles can play a key role in this vision through noninvasive assessments of mol. processes and specific cell populations in vivo, sensitive mol. diagnostics, and targeted delivery of therapeutics.  A superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle with a cross-linked dextran coating, or CLIO, is a powerful and illustrative nanoparticle platform for these applications.  These structures and their derivs. support diagnostic imaging by magnetic resonance (MRI), optical, and positron emission tomog. (PET) modalities and constitute a versatile platform for conjugation to targeting ligands.  A variety of conjugation methods exist to couple the dextran surface to different functional groups; in addn., a robust bioorthogonal [4 + 2] cycloaddn. reaction between 1,2,4,5-tetrazene (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) can conjugate nanoparticles to targeting ligands or label pretargeted cells.  The ready availability of conjugation methods has given rise to the synthesis of libraries of small mol. modified nanoparticles, which can then be screened for nanoparticles with specificity for a specific cell type.  Since most nanoparticles display their targeting ligands in a multivalent manner, a detailed understanding of the kinetics and affinity of a nanoparticle's interaction with its target (as detd. by surface plasmon resonance) can yield functionally important insights into nanoparticle design.  In this Account, we review applications of the CLIO platform in several areas relevant to the mission of personalized medicine.  We demonstrate rapid and highly sensitive mol. profiling of cancer markers ex vivo, as part of detailed, individualized mol. phenotyping.  The CLIO platform also facilitates targeted magnetic resonance and combined modality imaging (such as MR/PET/fluorescence/CT) to enable multiplexed measurement of mol. phenotypes in vivo for early diagnosis and disease classification.  Finally, the targeted delivery of a photodynamic therapy agent as part of a theranostic nanoparticle successfully increased local cell toxicity and minimized systemic side effects.\n",

      "A review.  Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopic techniques are widely used in humans both for clin. diagnostic applications and in basic research areas such as cognitive neuroimaging.  In recent years, new human MR systems have become available operating at static magnetic fields of 7T or higher (≥300MHz proton frequency).  Imaging human-sized objects at such high frequencies presents several challenges including non-uniform radiofrequency fields, enhanced susceptibility artifacts, and higher radiofrequency energy deposition in the tissue.  On the other side of the scale are gains in signal-to-noise or contrast-to-noise ratio that allow finer structures to be visualized and smaller physiol. effects to be detected.  This review presents an overview of some of the latest methodol. developments in human ultra-high field MRI/MRS as well as assocd. clin. and scientific applications.  Emphasis is given to techniques that particularly benefit from the changing phys. characteristics at high magnetic fields, including susceptibility-weighted imaging and phase-contrast techniques, imaging with X-nuclei, MR spectroscopy, CEST imaging, as well as functional MRI.  In addn., more general methodol. developments such as parallel transmission and motion correction will be discussed that are required to leverage the full potential of higher magnetic fields, and an overview of relevant physiol. considerations of human high magnetic field exposure is provided.\n",

      "Ion sensors based on colloidal nanoparticles (NPs), either as actively ion-sensing NPs or as nanoscale carrier systems for org. ion-sensing fluorescent chelators typically require a charged surface to be colloidally stable.  This surface charge significantly impacts the ion binding and affects the read-out.  Sensor read-out should be thus not detd. by the bulk ion concn., but by the local ion concn. in the nano-environment of the NP surface.  The authors present a conclusive model corroborated by exptl. data that reproduces the strong distance-dependence of the effect.  The exptl. data are based on the capability of tuning the distance of a pH-sensitive fluorophore to the surface of NPs in the nanometer (nm) range.  This in turn allows for modification of the effective acid dissocn. const. value (its logarithmic form, pKa) of analyte-sensitive fluorophores by tuning their distance to the underlying colloidal NPs.\n",

      "Upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are promising tools for background-free imaging and sensing.  However, their usefulness for in vivo applications depends on their biocompatibility, which the authors define by their optical performance in biol. environments and their toxicity in living organisms.  For UCNPs with a ratiometric color response to mech. stress, consistent emission intensity and color are desired for the particles under nonmech. stimuli.  Here, the authors test the biocompatibility and mechanosensitivity of α-NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaLuF4 nanoparticles.  First, the authors ligand-strip these particles to render them dispersible in aq. media.  Then, the authors characterize their mechanosensitivity (∼30% in the red-to-green spectral ratio per GPa), which is nearly 3-fold greater than those coated in oleic acid.  The authors next design a suite of ex vivo and in vivo tests to investigate their structural and optical properties under several biorelevant conditions: over time in various buffers types, as a function of pH, and in vivo along the digestive tract of Caenorhabditis elegans worms.  Finally, to ensure that the particles do not perturb biol. function in C. elegans, the authors assess the chronic toxicity of nanoparticle ingestion using a reproductive brood assay.  In these ways, the authors det. that mechanosensitive UCNPs are biocompatible, i.e., optically robust and nontoxic, for use as in vivo sensors to study animal digestion.\n",

      "A review.  Cellular signalling is governed in large part by mech. forces and electromagnetic fields.  Mech. forces play a crit. role in cell differentiation, tissue organization and diseases such as cancer and heart disease; elec. fields are essential for intercellular communication, muscle contraction, neural signalling and sensory perception.  Therefore, quantifying a biol. system's forces and fields is crucial for understanding physiol. and disease pathol. and for developing medical tools for repair and recovery.  This Review highlights advances in sensing mech. forces and elec. fields in vivo, focusing on optical probes.  The emergence of biocompatible optical probes, such as genetically encoded voltage indicators, mol. rotors, fluorescent dyes, semiconducting nanoparticles, plasmonic nanoparticles and lanthanide-doped up-converting nanoparticles, offers exciting opportunities to push the limits of spatial and temporal resoln., stability, multi-modality and stimuli sensitivity in bioimaging.  We further discuss the materials design principles behind these probes and compare them across various metrics to facilitate sensor selection.  Finally, we examine which advances are necessary to fully unravel the role of mech. forces and elec. fields in vivo, such as the ability to probe the vectorial nature of forces, the development of combined force and field sensors, and the design of efficient optical actuators.\n",

      "Nanocarriers for chemo-photothermal therapy suffer from insufficient retention at the tumor site and poor penetration into tumor parenchyma.  A smart drug-dye-based micelle is designed by making the best of the structural features of small-mol. drugs.  P-DOX is synthesized by conjugating doxorubicin (DOX) with poly(4-formylphenyl methacrylate-co-2-(diethylamino) Et methacrylate)-b-polyoligoethyleneglycol methacrylate (P(FPMA-co-DEA)-b-POEGMA) via imine linkage.  Through the π-π stacking interaction, IR780, a near-IR fluorescence dye as well as a photothermal agent, is integrated into the micelles (IR780-PDMs) with the P-DOX.  The IR780-PDMs show remarkably long blood circulation (t1/2β = 22.6 h).  As a result, a progressive tumor accumulation and retention are presented, which is significant to the sequential drug release.  Moreover, when entering into a moderate acidic tumor microenvironment, IR780-PDMs can dissoc. into small-size conjugates and IR780, which obviously increases the penetration depth of drugs, and then improves the lethality to deep-seated tumor cells.  Owing to the high delivery efficiency and superior chemo-photothermal therapeutic efficacy of IR780-PDMs, 97.6% tumor growth in the A549 tumor-bearing mice is suppressed with a low dose of i.v. injection (DOX, 1.5 mg kg-1; IR780, 0.8 mg kg-1).  This work presents a brand-new strategy for long-acting intensive cancer therapy.\n",

      "Exosomes (Exos) of approx. 30-150 nm in diams. are the promising vehicles for therapeutic drugs.  However, several challenges still exist in clin. applications, such as unsatisfied yield of exosomes, complicated labeling procedure and low drug loading efficiency.  In this work, the gram-scale amt. of high-purity urinary exosomes can be obtained from gastric cancer patients by non-invasive method.  Passion fruit-like Exo-PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanovehicles were fabricated by considerable freshly-urinary Exos loaded efficiently with multi-functionalized PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanoparticles via instant electroporation strategy.  In this system, prepd. Exo-PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanovehicles could be internalized into cancer cells effectively, and could delay the endocytosis of macrophages and prolong blood circulation time owing to its membrane structure and antigens.  Under 633 nm laser irradn. and acidic condition, the structures of nanovehicles would be collapsed and tremendous PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanoparticles could be released inside cancer cells, produced considerable singlet oxygen, inhibiting growth of tumor cells.  In vivo expt. of MGC-803 tumor-bearing nude mice showed that prepd. Exo-PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanovehicles could target tumor cells with deep penetration and superior retention performance in tumors.  This work reports a reliable conjugation-free labeling strategy for tracking exosomes harvested from human urine.  Moreover, the integration of multifunctional nanoparticles with urinary Exos paves a versatile road for the development of cancer-targeted photodynamic therapy.\n",

      "Recently, there is one-fifth of human deaths caused by cancer, leading to cancer treatment remains a hard nut to crack in the medical field.  Therefore, as an emerging diagnostic technol., mesoporous nanomaterials-based drug delivery systems integrated diagnosis and therapy have aroused tremendous interest owing to visually targeting effect and superior therapy efficacy compared with traditional cancer treatment.  In this work, we have successfully synthesized mesoporous carbon-gold hybrid nanozyme nanoprobes, whereby mesoporous carbon nanospheres were doped with small gold nanoparticles (OMCAPs) and further stabilized with a complex of reduced serum albumin and folic acid (rBSA-FA).  After loading IR780 iodide, the OMCAPs@ rBSA-FA@IR780 nanoprobes were finally accomplished for real-time imaging, photothermal/photodynamic and nanozyme oxidative therapy.  Herein, acid oxidized MCAPs possessed large surface area and numerous -COOH groups, which could be used to surface chem. modify numerous targeting mols. and load abundant NIR dye IR780, as well as be acted as photothermal reagents to enhance photothermal therapy effect.  In addn., the small Au NPs embedded in OMCAPs were utilized as nanozyme to catalyze H2O2 located in tumor cells to generate ·OH for intracellular oxidative damage of tumor.  Besides, as a commonly used near-IR (NIR) fluorescence dye, the loaded IR780 iodide could not only apply for real-time imaging, but also effectively enhance photo-thermal therapy (PTT) upon the 808 nm laser irradn.  Moreover, FA mols. could enhance the targeted efficiency of the nanoprobes to the gastric tumor site.  According to the systematical study in vitro and in vivo, our fabricated nanoprobes based on carbon-gold hybrid (OMCAPs@ rBSA-FA@IR780) revealed excellent tumor targeting efficacy, long tumor retention and favorably therapeutic effect for tumor.  All the results demonstrated that here synthesized probes exhibited excellently diagnostic and therapeutic performance, indicating our technol. may potentially offer an outstanding strategy for tumor-targeting theranostics.\n",

      "X-ray luminescent nanoparticles (NPs), including lanthanide fluorides, have been evaluated for application to deep tissue in vivo mol. imaging using optical tomog.  A combination of high material d., higher at. no. and efficient NIR luminescence from compatible lanthanide dopant ions indicates that particles that consist of ALnF4 (A = alk., Ln = lanthanide element) may offer a very attractive class of materials for high resoln., deep tissue imaging with X-ray excitation.  NaGdF4:Eu3+ NPs produced an X-ray excited luminescence that was among the most efficient of nanomaterials that have been studied thus far.  We have systematically studied factors such as (a) the crystal structure that changes the lattice environment of the doped Eu3+ ions within the unit cell; and extrinsic factors such as (b) a gold coating (with attendant biocompatibility) that couples to a plasmonic excitation, and (c) changes in the NPs surface properties via changes in the pH of the suspending medium-all with a significant impact on the X-ray excited luminescence of NaGdF4:Eu3+NPs.  The luminescence from an optimally doped hexagonal phase NaGdF4:Eu3+ nanoparticle was 25% more intense compared to that of a cubic structure.  We obsd. evidence of plasmonic reabsorption of midwavelength emission by a gold coating on hexagonal NaGdF4:Eu3+ NPs; fortunately, the NaGdF4:Eu3+ @Au core-shell NPs retained the efficient 5D0→7F4 NIR (692 nm) luminescence.  The NaGdF4:Eu3+ NPs exhibited sensitivity to the ambient pH when excited by X-rays, an effect not seen with UV excitation.  The sensitivity to the local environment can be understood in terms of the sensitivity of the excitons that are generated by the high energy X-rays (and not by UV photons) to crystal structure and to the surface state of the particles.\n",

      "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) could be highly selective and noninvasive, with low side effects as an adjuvant therapy for cancer treatment.  Because excitation sources such as UV and visible lights for most of the photosensitizers do not penetrate deeply enough into biol. tissues, PDT is useful only when the lesions are located within 10 mm below the skin.  In addn., there is no prior example of theranostics capable of both PDT and imaging with a single deep-penetrating X-ray excitation source.  Here we report a new theranostic scintillator nanoparticle (ScNP) composite in a core-shell-shell arrangement, i.e., NaLuF4:Gd(35%),Eu(15%)@NaLuF4:Gd(40%)@NaLuF4:Gd(35%),Tb(15%), which is capable of being excited by a single X-ray radiation source to allow potentially deep tissue PDT and optical imaging with a low dark cytotoxicity and effective photocytotoxicity.  With the X-ray excitation, the ScNPs can emit visible light at 543 nm (from Tb3+) to stimulate the loaded rose bengal (RB) photosensitizer and cause death of efficient MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancer cells.  The ScNPs can also emit light at 614 and 695 nm (from Eu3+) for luminescence imaging.  The middle shell in the core-shell-shell ScNPs is unique to sep. the Eu3+ in the core and the Tb3+ in the outer shell to prevent resonance quenching between them and to result in good PDT efficiency.  Also, it was demonstrated that although the addn. of a mesoporous SiO2 layer resulted in the transfer of 82.7% fluorescence resonance energy between Tb3+ and RB, the subsequent conversion of the energy from RB to generate 1O2 was hampered, although the loaded amt. of the RB was almost twice that without the mSiO2 layer.  A unique method to compare the wt % and mol % compns. calcd. by using the morphol. transmission electron microscope images and the inductively coupled plasma elemental anal. data of the core, core-shell, and core-shell-shell ScNPs is also introduced.\n",

      "Development of multimodal contrast agents for in vivo simultaneous multimodality imaging is an emerging interdiscipline that is paving the avenue toward the goal of personalized medicine.  Herein, folic acid-conjugated silica-modified LaF3:Yb,Tm upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs@SiO2-FA) with high La content in a single particle were strategically designed and prepd. for simultaneously targeting dual-modality imaging of upconversion luminescence (UCL) and X-ray computed tomog. (CT).  LaF3 UCNPs were synthesized by a novel oleic acid (OA)/ionic liq. (IL) two-phase system.  Afterward, a folic acid mol. was covalently anchored on the surface of UCNPs with a silane coupling agent.  The UCNPs@SiO2-FA exhibits good stability, water dispersibility and soly., low cytotoxicity, good biocompatibility, highly selective targeting, excellent X-ray attenuation, and UCL emission under excitation at 980 nm.  In vivo UCL and CT images of mice show the UCNPs@SiO2-FA can be used in targeting dual-modality imaging.  These results suggest that the as-prepd. nanoprobe is a good candidate with excellent imaging and targeting ability for targeting dual-modality imaging of UCL and CT.\n",

      "A review.  For centuries, cell biol. has been based on light microscopy and at the same time been limited by its optical resoln.  However, several new technologies have been developed recently that bypass this limit.  These new super-resoln. technologies are either based on tailored illumination, nonlinear fluorophore responses, or the precise localization of single mols.  Overall, these new approaches have created unprecedented new possibilities to investigate the structure and function of cells.\n",

      "A review.  Achieving a spatial resoln. that is not limited by the diffraction of light, recent developments of super-resoln. fluorescence microscopy techniques allow the observation of many biol. structures not resolvable in conventional fluorescence microscopy.  New advances in these techniques now give them the ability to image three-dimensional (3D) structures, measure interactions by multicolor colocalization, and record dynamic processes in living cells at the nanometer scale.  It is anticipated that super-resoln. fluorescence microscopy will become a widely used tool for cell and tissue imaging to provide previously unobserved details of biol. structures and processes.\n",

      "Exposure of cells to colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) can have concn.-dependent harmful effects.  Mostly, such effects are monitored with biochem. assays or probes from mol. biol., i.e. viability assays, gene expression profiles, etc., neglecting that the presence of NPs can also drastically affect cellular morphol.  In the case of polymer-coated Au NPs upon NP internalization, cells undergo lysosomal swelling, alterations in mitochondrial morphol., disturbances in actin and tubulin cytoskeleton and assocd. signaling, and redn. of focal adhesion contact area and no. of filopodia.  Appropriate imaging and data treatment techniques allow for quant. analyses of these concn.-dependent changes.  Abnormalities in morphol. occur at similar (or even lower) NP concns. as the onset of reduced cellular viability.  Cellular morphol. is thus an important quant. indicator to verify harmful effects of NPs to cells, without requiring biochem. assays, but relying on appropriate staining and imaging techniques.\n",

      "DC-SIGN, a Ca2+-dependent transmembrane lectin, is found assembled in microdomains on the plasma membranes of dendritic cells.  These microdomains bind a large variety of pathogens and facilitate their uptake for subsequent antigen presentation.  In this study, DC-SIGN dynamics in microdomains were explored with several fluorescence microscopy methods and compared with dynamics for influenza hemagglutinin (HA), which is also found in plasma membrane microdomains.  Fluorescence imaging indicated that DC-SIGN microdomains may contain other C-type lectins and that the DC-SIGN cytoplasmic region is not required for microdomain formation.  Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements showed that neither full-length nor cytoplasmically truncated DC-SIGN in microdomains appreciably exchanged with like mols. in other microdomains and the membrane surround, whereas HA in microdomains exchanged almost completely.  Line-scan fluorescence correlation spectroscopy indicated an essentially undetectable lateral mobility for DC-SIGN but an appreciable mobility for HA within their resp. domains.  Single-particle tracking with defined-valency quantum dots confirmed that HA has significant mobility within microdomains, whereas DC-SIGN does not.  By contrast, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicated that inner leaflet lipids are able to move through DC-SIGN microdomains.  The surprising stability of DC-SIGN microdomains may reflect structural features that enhance pathogen uptake either by providing high-avidity platforms and/or by protecting against rapid microdomain endocytosis.\n",

On the basis of the strong Tm3+ ion emission (at ∼800 nm), tissue penetration depths as large as 2 mm have been demonstrated, which are >4 times those achievable based on the visible emissions in comparable CaF2:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles.

      "Multiphoton intravital microscopy (MP-IVM) is a powerful tool to image cells in vivo.  Its application in immunol. research has opened new horizons, allowing intravital imaging of leukocytes at the single-cell level.  A transparent cornea is vital to retain vision.  As an immune privileged site, a rapid innate response to foreign antigens is crucial in clearing opportunistic bacterial and viral pathogens, and minimizing collateral structural damage to the cornea.  Furthermore, dissecting the mechanisms and preventing the immunol. rejection process after corneal transplantation is imperative to retain sight.  Attempts of intravital imaging of mandibular dLNs have yielded little success to date, due to breathing artifacts and the location that is difficult to access.  Herein, we present the first MP-IVM mouse model of the mandibular dLNs, utilizing transgenic mice in which CD11c+ cells are fluorescently labeled.  The meandering index, an index for directionality, is significantly increased after allogeneic corneal transplantation at both 14 and 21 days, compared to steady state (p < 0.001).  Taken together, our study demonstrates the necessary methodol. required for intravital multiphoton imaging of the mandibular dLNs, allowing visualization of spatiotemporal kinetics of immune cells in vivo, and provides a window into the corneal immune reflex arc.  This technique will be a powerful tool to investigate the pathogenesis of ocular immune and inflammatory diseases.\n",

      "Quantification of the angular orientation distribution of fibrous tissue structures in scientific images benefits from the Fourier image anal. to obtain quant. information.  Measurement uncertainties represent a major challenge and need to be considered by propagating them in order to det. an adaptive anisotropic Fourier filter.  Our adaptive filter method (AF) is based on the max. relative uncertainty δcut of the power spectrum as well as a weighted radial sum with weighting factor α.  We use a Monte-Carlo simulation to obtain realistic greyscale images that include defined variations in fiber thickness, length, and angular dispersion as well as variations in noise.  From this simulation the best agreement between predefined and derived angular orientation distribution is found for evaluation parameters δcut = 2.1% and α = 1.5.  The resulting cumulative orientation distribution was modeled by a sigmoid function to obtain the mean angle and the fiber dispersion.  A comparison to a state-of-the-art band-pass method revealed that the AF method is more suitable for the application on greyscale fiber images, since the error of the fiber dispersion significantly decreased from (33.9 ± 26.5)% to (13.2 ± 12.7)%.  Both methods were found to accurately quantify the mean fiber orientation with an error of (1.9 ± 1.5)° and (2.3 ± 2.1)° in case of the AF and the band-pass method, resp.  We demonstrate that the AF method is able to accurately quantify the fiber orientation distribution in in vivo second-harmonic generation images of dermal collagen with a mean fiber orientation error of (6.0 ± 4.0)° and a dispersion error of (9.3 ± 12.1)%.\n",

      "Mitochondria form dynamic networks which adapt to the environmental requirements of the cell.  We investigated the aging process of these networks in human skin cells in vivo by multiphoton microscopy.  A study on the age-dependency of the mitochondrial network in young and old volunteers revealed that keratinocytes in old skin establish a significantly more fragmented network with smaller and more compact mitochondrial clusters than keratinocytes in young skin.  Furthermore, we investigated the mitochondrial network during differentiation processes of keratinocytes within the epidermis of volunteers.  We observe a fragmentation similar to the age-dependent study in almost all parameters.  These parallels raise questions about the dynamics of biophys. network structures during aging processes.\n",

      "Raman micro-spectroscopy provides a convenient non-destructive and location-specific means of probing cellular physiol. and tissue physiol. at sub-micron length scales.  By probing the vibrational signature of mols. and mol. groups, the distribution and metabolic products of small mols. that cannot be labeled with fluorescent dyes can be analyzed.  This method works well for mol. concns. in the micro-molar range and has been demonstrated as a valuable tool for monitoring drug-cell interactions.  If the small mol. of interest does not contain groups that would allow for a discrimination against cytoplasmic background signals, \"labeling\" of the mol. by isotope substitution or by incorporating other unique small groups, e.g. alkynes provides a stable signal even for time-lapse imaging such compds. in living cells.  In this review we highlight recent progress in assessing the physiol. of cells and tissue by Raman spectroscopy and imaging.\n",

      "A review.  The discovery of the enhancement of Raman scattering by mols. adsorbed on nanostructured metal surfaces is a landmark in the history of spectroscopic and anal. techniques.  Significant exptl. and theor. effort has been directed toward understanding the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect and demonstrating its potential in various types of ultrasensitive sensing applications in a wide variety of fields.  In the 45 years since its discovery, SERS has blossomed into a rich area of research and technol., but addnl. efforts are still needed before it can be routinely used anal. and in com. products.  In this Review, prominent authors from around the world joined together to summarize the state of the art in understanding and using SERS and to predict what can be expected in the near future in terms of research, applications, and technol. development.  This Review is dedicated to SERS pioneer and our coauthor, the late Prof. Richard Van Duyne, whom we lost during the prepn. of this article.\n",

      "Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful technique for characterization of biol. samples.  SERS spectra from healthy brain tissue and tumors are obtained by sudden freezing of tissue in liq. nitrogen and crashing and mixing it with a concd. silver colloidal suspension.  The acquired spectra from tissues show significant spectral differences that can be used to identify whether it is from a healthy region or tumor.  The most significant change on SERS spectra from the healthy/peripheral brain tissue to tumor is the increase of the ratio of the peaks at around 723 to 655 cm-1.  In addn., the spectral changes indicate that the protein content in tumors increases compared to the peripheral/healthy tissue as obsd. with tumor invasion.  The preliminary results show that SERS spectra can be used for a quick diagnosis due to the simplicity of the sample prepn. and the speed of the spectral acquisition.\n",

Here, we address this quandary using split-fluorescent protein (FP) fragments as molecular glue and switchable Raman reporters to assemble gold or silver plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) into photonic clusters directly in live cells.  When targeted to diffusing surface biomarkers in cancer cells, the NPs self-assemble into surface-enhanced Raman-scattering (SERS) nanoclusters having hot spots homogenously seeded by the reconstruction of full-length FPs.  Within plasmonic hot spots, autocatalytic activation of the FP chromophore and near-field amplification of its Raman fingerprints enable selective and sensitive SERS imaging of targeted cells.  This FP-driven assembly of metal colloids also yields enhanced photoacoustic signals, allowing the hybrid FP/NP nanoclusters to serve as contrast agents for multimodal SERS and photoacoustic microscopy with single-cell sensitivity.\n",

      "A review.  The authors have recently witnessed a major improvement in the quality of nanoparticles encoded with Raman-active mols. (SERS tags).  Such a progress relied mainly on a major improvement of fabrication methods for building-blocks, resulting in widespread application of this powerful tool in various fields, with the potential to replace commonly used techniques, such as those based on fluorescence.  The authors present hereby a brief perspective on SERS tags, regarding their compn., morphol. and structure, and describe the own selection from the current state-of-the-art.  The authors then focus on the main bioimaging applications of SERS tags, showing a gradual evolution from two-dimensional studies to three-dimensional anal.  Recent improvements in sensitivity and multiplexing ability have enabled great advancements toward in vivo applications, e.g. highlighting tumor boundaries to guide surgery.  In addn., the high level of biomol. sensitivity reached by SERS tags, promises an expansion toward biomarker detection in cases for which traditional methods offer limited reliability, as a consequence of the frequently low analyte concns.\n",

      "A review.  In vivo imaging, which enables researchers to peer deeply within living subjects, is producing tremendous opportunities both for clin. diagnostics and as a research tool.  Contrast material is often required to clearly visualize the functional architecture of physiol. structures.  Recent advances in nanomaterials are becoming pivotal to generate the high-resoln., high-contrast images needed for accurate, precision diagnostics.  Nanomaterials are playing major roles in imaging by delivering large imaging payloads, yielding improved sensitivity, multiplexing capacity, and modularity of design.  Indeed, for several imaging modalities, nanomaterials are now not simply ancillary contrast entities, but are instead the original and sole source of image signal that make possible the modality's existence.  The authors address the physicochem. makeup/design of nanomaterials through the lens of the phys. properties that produce contrast signal for the cognate imaging modality; the authors stratify nanomaterials on the basis of their (1) magnetic, (2) optical, (3) acoustic, and/or (4) nuclear properties.  The authors evaluate them for their ability to provide relevant information under preclin. and clin. circumstances, their in vivo safety profiles (which are being incorporated into their chem. design), their modularity in being fused to create multimodal nanomaterials (spanning multiple different phys. imaging modalities and therapeutic/theranostic capabilities), their key properties, and critically their likelihood to be clin. translated.\n",

      "Raman spectroscopy is a newly developed, noninvasive preclin. imaging technique that offers picomolar sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities to the field of mol. imaging.  In this study, we demonstrate the ability of Raman spectroscopy to sep. the spectral fingerprints of up to 10 different types of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles in a living mouse after s.c. injection.  Based on these spectral results, we simultaneously injected the five most intense and spectrally unique SERS nanoparticles i.v. to image their natural accumulation in the liver.  All five types of SERS nanoparticles were successfully identified and spectrally sepd. using our optimized noninvasive Raman imaging system.  In addn., we were able to linearly correlate Raman signal with SERS concn. after injecting four spectrally unique SERS nanoparticles either s.c. (R2 = 0.998) or i.v. (R2 = 0.992).  These results show great potential for multiplexed imaging in living subjects in cases in which several targeted SERS probes could offer better detection of multiple biomarkers assocd. with a specific disease.\n",

      "Labeled nanoparticles have attracted much interest toward applications in bioimaging and diagnostics.  In particular, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotags have been demonstrated to be excellent candidates for multiplexed imaging and biol. detection.  The authors propose an alternative, effective method to easily prep. gold nanostars exhibiting plasmon bands in the near IR range, encoded with Raman reporter mols., concomitantly acting as capping agents which are then protected with an amphiphilic polymer.  The resulting nanotags are non-cytotoxic and display long-term stability against aggregation and reporter leakage, while showing reproducible SERS signals suitable for multiplexing.  These tags were used to distinguish five different types of breast cancer cells by imaging of a quintuple cell coculture.  Time-lapse SERS imaging of the coculture was addnl. performed, demonstrating the applicability of these nanotags for cell tracing over time scales >24 h.\n",

      "Methods to image complex 3D cell cultures are limited by issues such as fluorophore photobleaching and decompn., poor excitation light penetration, and lack of complementary techniques to verify the 3D structure.  Although it remains insufficiently demonstrated, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging is a promising tool for the characterization of biol. complex systems.  To this aim, a controllable 3D cell culture model which spans nearly 1 cm2 in surface footprint is designed.  This structure is composed of fibroblasts contg. SERS-encoded nanoparticles (i.e., SERS tags), arranged in an alternating layered structure.  This \"sandwich\" type structure allows monitoring of the SERS signals in the z-axis and with mm dimensions in the xy-axis.  Taking advantage of correlative microscopy techniques such as electron microscopy, it is possible to corroborate nanoparticle positioning and distances in z-depths of up to 150μm.  This study reveals a proof-of-concept method for detailed 3D SERS imaging of a complex, dense 3D cell culture model.\n",

      "A review.  Changes in protein expression levels and protein structure may indicate genomic mutations and may be related to some diseases.  Therefore, the precise quantification and characterization of proteins can be used for disease diagnosis.  Compared with several other alternative methods, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy is regarded as an excellent choice for the quantification and structural characterization of proteins.  Herein, the authors review the main advance of using plasmonic nanostructures as SERS sensing platform for this purpose.  Three design approaches, including direct SERS, indirect SERS, and SERS-encoded nanoparticles, are discussed in the direction of developing new precise approaches of quantification and characterization of proteins.  While this Review is focused on proteins, in order to highlight concepts of SERS-based sensors also detection of other biomols. will be discussed.\n",

The demonstrated mol.-release mechanism relies on the use of near-IR light coupled to the plasmonic absorption of the core gold nanostars, which creates local temp. gradients and thus, bisbenzimide thermodiffusion.

      "PURPOSE:  In preclinical cancer studies, non-invasive functional imaging has become an important tool to assess tumor development and therapeutic effects.  Tumor hypoxia is closely associated with tumor aggressiveness and is therefore a key parameter to be monitored.  Recently, photoacoustic (PA) imaging with inherently co-registered high-frequency ultrasound (US) has reached preclinical applicability, allowing parallel collection of anatomical and functional information.  Dual-wavelength PA imaging can be used to quantify tissue oxygen saturation based on the absorbance spectrum differences between hemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:  A new bi-modal PA/US system for small animal imaging was employed to test feasibility and reliability of dual-wavelength PA for measuring relative tissue oxygenation.  Murine models of pancreatic and colon cancer were imaged, and differences in tissue oxygenation were compared to immunohistochemistry for hypoxia in the corresponding tissue regions.  RESULTS:  Functional studies proved feasibility and reliability of oxygenation detection in murine tissue in vivo.  Tumor models exhibited different levels of hypoxia in localized regions, which positively correlated with immunohistochemical staining for hypoxia.  Contrast-enhanced imaging yielded complementary information on tissue perfusion using the same system.  CONCLUSION:  Bimodal PA/US imaging can be utilized to reliably detect hypoxic tumor regions in murine tumor models, thus providing the possibility to collect anatomical and functional information on tumor growth and treatment response live in longitudinal preclinical studies.\n",

      "Ultrasound is among the most widely used biomedical imaging modalities, but has limited ability to image specific mol. targets due to the lack of suitable nanoscale contrast agents.  Gas vesicles, genetically encoded protein nanostructures isolated from buoyant photosynthetic microbes, have recently been identified as nanoscale reporters for ultrasound.  Their unique phys. properties give gas vesicles significant advantages over conventional microbubble contrast agents, including nanoscale dimensions and inherent phys. stability.  Furthermore, as a genetically encoded material, gas vesicles present the possibility that the nanoscale mech., acoustic, and targeting properties of an imaging agent can be engineered at the level of its constituent proteins.  Here, genetic engineering of gas vesicles results in nanostructures with new mech., acoustic, surface, and functional properties to enable harmonic, multiplexed, and multimodal ultrasound imaging as well as cell-specific mol. targeting.  These results establish a biomol. platform for the engineering of acoustic nanomaterials.\n",

      "Phagocytic clearance and lysosomal processing of pathogens and debris are essential functions of the innate immune system.  However, the assessment of these functions in vivo is challenging because most nanoscale contrast agents compatible with noninvasive imaging techniques are made from nonbiodegradable synthetic materials that do not undergo regular lysosomal degrdn.  To overcome this challenge, the authors describe the use of an all-protein contrast agent to directly visualize and quantify phagocytic and lysosomal activities in vivo by ultrasound imaging.  This contrast agent is based on gas vesicles (GVs), a class of air-filled protein nanostructures naturally expressed by buoyant microbes.  Using a combination of ultrasound imaging, pharmacol., immunohistol., and live-cell optical microscopy, after i.v. injection, GVs are cleared from circulation by liver-resident macrophages.  Once internalized, the GVs undergo lysosomal degrdn., resulting in the elimination of their ultrasound contrast.  By noninvasively monitoring the temporal dynamics of GV-generated ultrasound signal in circulation and in the liver and fitting them with a pharmacokinetic model, the authors can quantify the rates of phagocytosis and lysosomal degrdn. in living animals.  The authors demonstrate the utility of this method by showing how these rates are perturbed in two models of liver dysfunction: phagocyte deficiency and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.  The combination of proteolytically degradable nanoscale contrast agents and quant. ultrasound imaging thus enables noninvasive functional imaging of cellular degradative processes.\n",

      "Ultrasound is among the most widely used non-invasive imaging modalities in biomedicine, but plays a surprisingly small role in mol. imaging due to a lack of suitable mol. reporters on the nanoscale.  Here, we introduce a new class of reporters for ultrasound based on genetically encoded gas nanostructures from microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.  Gas vesicles are gas-filled protein-shelled compartments with typical widths of 45-250 nm and lengths of 100-600 nm that exclude water and are permeable to gas.  We show that gas vesicles produce stable ultrasound contrast that is readily detected in vitro and in vivo, that their genetically encoded phys. properties enable multiple modes of imaging, and that contrast enhancement through aggregation permits their use as mol. biosensors.\n",

      "The optical technol. presents non-invasive, non-destructive, and non-ionizing features and has the ability to display various chem. components in tissues to provide useful information for various biomedical applications.  Regarding selection of light wavelengths, second near-IR (NIR-II, 900-1700 nm) light is a much better choice compared to both visible (380-780 nm) and traditional near-IR (780-900 nm) light, because of its advantages including deeper penetration into biol. tissues, less tissue scattering or absorption, and decreased interference by fluorescent proteins.  Thus, using optical nano-agents that absorb or emit light in the NIR-II window can achieve deeper tissue optical imaging with higher signal-to-background ratios and better spatial resoln. for diagnosis.  What's more, some of these nano-agents can be further applied for imaging guided surgical removal, real-time monitoring of drug delivery, labeling lymphatic metastasis, biosensing, and imaging guided phototherapy.  In this review, we attempt to summarize the recent advances of various NIR-II nano-agents (including single-walled carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, rare-earth doped nanoparticles, other inorg. nanomaterials, small org. mol.-based nanoparticles, and semiconducting polymer nanoparticles) in both bioimaging and therapeutic applications, and discuss the challenges and perspectives of these nano-agents for clin. practice in the near future.\n",

      "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has emerged as a novel, non-invasive imaging modality that allows the detailed study of flow within the vascular structures of the eye.  Compared to conventional dye angiography, OCTA can produce more detailed, higher resolution images of the vasculature without the added risk of dye injection.  In our review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new technology in comparison to conventional dye angiography.  We provide an overview of the current OCTA technology available, compare the various commercial OCTA machines technical specifications and discuss some future software improvements.  An approach to the interpretation of OCTA images by correlating images to other multimodal imaging with attention to identifying potential artefacts will be outlined and may be useful to ophthalmologists, particularly those who are currently still unfamiliar with this new technology.  This review is based on a search of peer-reviewed published papers relevant to OCTA according to our current knowledge, up to January 2017, available on the PubMed database.  Currently, many of the published studies have focused on OCTA imaging of the retina, in particular, the use of OCTA in the diagnosis and management of common retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and retinal vascular diseases.  In addition, we describe clinical applications for OCTA imaging in inflammatory diseases, optic nerve diseases and anterior segment diseases.  This review is based on both the current literature and the clinical experience of our individual authors, with an emphasis on the clinical applications of this imaging technology.\n",

      "Acquisition of high-resoln. images from within internal organs using endoscopic optical imaging has numerous clin. applications.  However, difficulties assocd. with optical aberrations and the trade-off between transverse resoln. and depth of focus significantly limit the scope of applications.  Here, we integrate a metalens, with the ability to modify the phase of incident light at subwavelength level, into the design of an endoscopic optical coherence tomog. catheter (termed nano-optic endoscope) to achieve near diffraction-limited imaging through negating non-chromatic aberrations.  Remarkably, the tailored chromatic dispersion of the metalens in the context of spectral interferometry is utilized to maintain high-resoln. imaging beyond the input field Rayleigh range, easing the trade-off between transverse resoln. and depth of focus.  We demonstrate endoscopic imaging in resected human lung specimens and in sheep airways in vivo.  The combination of the superior resoln. and higher imaging depth of focus of the nano-optic endoscope is likely to increase the clin. utility of endoscopic optical imaging.\n",

      "Optical coherence tomog. (OCT) is an emerging biomedical optical imaging technique that performs high-resoln., cross-sectional tomog. imaging of microstructure in biol. systems.  OCT can achieve image resolns. of 1-15 μm, one to two orders of magnitude finer than std. ultrasound.  The image penetration depth of OCT is detd. by the optical scattering and is up to 2-3 mm in tissue.  OCT functions as a type of 'optical biopsy' to provide cross-sectional images of tissue structure on the micron scale.  It is a promising imaging technol. because it can provide images of tissue in situ and in real time, without the need for excision and processing of specimens.\n",

      "Optical Coherence Tomog. (OCT) enables real-time imaging of living tissues at cell-scale resoln. over millimeters in three dimensions.  Despite these advantages, functional biol. studies with OCT have been limited by a lack of exogenous contrast agents that can be distinguished from tissue.  Here we report an approach to functional OCT imaging that implements custom algorithms to spectrally identify unique contrast agents: large gold nanorods (LGNRs).  LGNRs exhibit 110-fold greater spectral signal per particle than conventional GNRs, which enables detection of individual LGNRs in water and concns. as low as 250 pM in the circulation of living mice.  This translates to ∼40 particles per imaging voxel in vivo.  Unlike previous implementations of OCT spectral detection, the methods described herein adaptively compensate for depth and processing artifacts on a per sample basis.  Collectively, these methods enable high-quality noninvasive contrast-enhanced imaging of OCT in living subjects, including detection of tumor microvasculature at twice the depth achievable with conventional OCT.  Addnl., multiplexed detection of spectrally-distinct LGNRs was demonstrated to observe discrete patterns of lymphatic drainage and identify individual lymphangions and lymphatic valve functional states.  These capabilities provide a powerful platform for mol. imaging and characterization of tissue noninvasively at cellular resoln., called MOZART.\n",

      "Multimodal imaging with photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be an effective method to evaluate the choroidal and retinal microvasculature.  To improve the efficiency for visualizing capillaries, colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been applied as a multimodal contrast agent for both OCT and PAM imaging by taking advantage of the strong optical scattering and the strong optical absorption of AuNPs due to their surface plasmon resonance.  Ultra-pure AuNPs were fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation, capped with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and administered to 13 New Zealand white rabbits and 3 Dutch Belted pigmented rabbits.  The synthesized PEG-AuNPs (20.0 ± 1.5 nm) were demonstrated to be excellent contrast agents for PAM and OCT, and do not demonstrate cytotoxicity to bovine retinal endothelial cells in cell studies.  The image signal from the retinal and choroidal vessels in living rabbits was enhanced by up to 82% for PAM and up to 45% for OCT, respectively, by the administered PEG-AuNPs, which enables detection of individual blood vessels by both imaging modalities.  The biodistribution study demonstrated the AuNP accumulated primarily in the liver and spleen.  Histology and TUNEL staining did not indicate cell injury or death in the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, heart, or eyes up to seven days after AuNP administration.  PEG-AuNPs offer an efficient and safe contrast agent for multimodal ocular imaging to achieve improved characterization of microvasculature.\n",

      "Optical coherence tomog. angiog. (OCTA) is an important tool for investigating vascular networks and microcirculation in living tissue.  Traditional OCTA detects blood vessels via intravascular dynamic scattering signals derived from the movements of red blood cells (RBCs).  However, the low hematocrit and long latency between RBCs in capillaries make these OCTA signals discontinuous, leading to incomplete mapping of the vascular networks.  OCTA imaging of microvascular circulation is particularly challenging in tumors due to the abnormally slow blood flow in angiogenic tumor vessels and strong attenuation of light by tumor tissue.  Here, we demonstrate in vivo that gold nanoprisms (GNPRs) can be used as OCT contrast agents working in the second near-IR window, significantly enhancing the dynamic scattering signals in microvessels and improving the sensitivity of OCTA in skin tissue and melanoma tumors in live mice.  With GNPRs as contrast agents, the postinjection OCT angiograms showed 41 and 59% more microvasculature than preinjection angiograms in healthy mouse skin and melanoma tumors, resp.  By enabling better characterization of microvascular circulation in vivo, GNPR-enhanced OCTA could lead to better understanding of vascular functions during pathol. conditions, more accurate measurements of therapeutic response, and improved patient prognoses.\n",

      "Current imaging techniques capable of tracking nanoparticles in vivo supply either a large field of view or cellular resolution, but not both.  Here, we demonstrate a multimodality imaging platform of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for high resolution, wide field of view in vivo imaging of nanoparticles.  This platform includes the first in vivo images of nanoparticle pharmacokinetics acquired with photothermal OCT (PTOCT), along with overlaying images of microvascular and tissue morphology.  Gold nanorods (51.8 ± 8.1 nm by 15.2 ± 3.3 nm) were intravenously injected into mice, and their accumulation into mammary tumors was non-invasively imaged in vivo in three dimensions over 24 hours using PTOCT.  Spatial frequency analysis of PTOCT images indicated that gold nanorods reached peak distribution throughout the tumors by 16 hours, and remained well-dispersed up to 24 hours post-injection.  In contrast, the overall accumulation of gold nanorods within the tumors peaked around 16 hours post-injection.  The accumulation of gold nanorods within the tumors was validated post-mortem with multiphoton microscopy.  This shows the utility of PTOCT as part of a powerful multimodality imaging platform for the development of nanomedicines and drug delivery technologies.\n",

      "Biol. soft tissues are almost transparent to hard X rays and therefore cannot be investigated without enhancement with a contrast medium, such as iodine.  On the other hand, phase-contrast X-ray imaging is eensitive to light elements1-8.  This is because the X-ray pahse shift cross section is almost a thousand times larger than the X-ray absorption cross section for ligght elements such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen4,15.  Hence, phase-contrast X-ray imaging is a promising technique for observing the structure inside biol. soft tissues without the need for staining and without serious radiation exposure.  We have devised a means of observing biol. tissues in three dimensions using a novel X-ray computed tomog. (CT) by modifying the phase-contrast technique.  To generate appropriate CT input data, we used phase-mapping images obtained using an X-ray interferometer and computer anal. of interference patterns9.  Now, we present a three-dimensional observation result of a nonstained sample of a cancerous rabbit liver, using a synchrotron X-ray source.  Phase-contrast X-ray CT was able to clearly differentiate the cancer lesion from the normal tissue.  Moreover, fine structures corresponding to cancerous degeneration and fibrous tissues were clearly depicted.\n",

      "A review.  Semiconductor nanowires offer new opportunities for optoelectronic and spintronic nanodevices.  However, their full potential is ultimately dictated by our ability to control multiple property-function relationships taking place at the nanoscale in the spatial and time domains.  Only a combination of high-resoln. anal. techniques can provide a comprehensive understanding of their complex functionalities.  Here we describe how a multimodal hard X-ray nanoprobe addresses fundamental questions in nanowire research.  Selected topics ranging from cluster formation, dopant segregation, and phase sepns. to quantum confinement effects are investigated with sub-100 nm spatial resoln. and sub-50 ps temporal resoln.  This approach opens new avenues for structural, compn. and optical studies with broad applicability in materials science.\n",

To better understand the physiol. and acclimation capability of the cell, one of the great challenges of the future is to access the interior of a cell and unveil its chem. landscape (compn. and distribution of elements and mols.).  Chem. imaging has greatly improved in sensitivity and spatial resoln. to visualize and quantify nutrients, metabolites, toxic elements, and drugs in single cells at the subcellular level.  This review aims to present the current potential of these emerging imaging technologies and to guide biologists toward a strategy for interrogating biol. processes at the nanoscale.

      "A review.  Over the past few decades, material scientists have developed a wide variety of approaches to deliberately introduce chem. and structural inhomogeneities into nanoparticles, achieving for example intentional doping, concn. gradients, and multicomponent structures.  This perspective presents a sense of how modern hard X-ray spectroscopic methods, far from merely providing new tools, are extending the way we study and understand such complex nanoparticles.  Particularly, the possibility to select with high resoln. the incident and emission hard X-ray energies offers unprecedented site selectivity, and rapid data acquisition helps to uncover the complex chem. world behind the state-of-the-art synthetic methods like hot-injection, Brust-Schiffrin, supercrit.-flow, and nonaq. synthesis.  Therefore, today the in situ spectroscopic studies provide a new view into the genesis of heterogeneity in colloidal nanoparticles.\n",

      "The use of XANES spectroscopy, both in classical and in dispersive geometries, is illustrated for the study of copper-based catalysts under in situ or in operando conditions.  As case studies, copper-exchanged MFI zeolites and CuCl2/γ-Al2O3 systems are considered.  In the former case, in situ XANES spectroscopy was used to characterize well defined complexes (Cu+N2, Cu+(CO)3, Cu+(NH3)(CO) and Cu+(NO)2) formed on copper ions inside the zeolite cavities under controlled conditions.  From these results, useful information concerning the symmetry of the formed complexes can readily be gained.  The latter case shows how the use of dispersive XANES spectroscopy allows to follow, in real time, the evolution of a system in working conditions.  The simultaneous detn. of the catalyst activity and of the av. oxidn. state of copper in the catalyst allows the evolution of a system in working conditions to be followed in real time.  The criteria used for the quantification of the Cu(I) and Cu(II) fraction from XANES spectra are discussed in detail.\n",

An understanding of the functions of these nanoscale elements is key to elucidating cellular function.  In this review, the authors describe the advances in x-ray scattering and diffraction techniques for imaging biol. systems at the nanoscale.  The authors present a no. of principal technol. advances in x-ray optics and development of sample environments.  The authors identify radiation damage as one of the most severe challenges in the field, thus rendering the dose an important parameter when putting different x-ray methods in perspective.  Furthermore, the authors describe different successful approaches, including scanning and full-field techniques, along with prominent examples.  Finally, the authors present a few recent studies that combined several techniques in one expt. to collect highly complementary data for a multidimensional sample characterization.\n",

      "In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to X-ray phase contrast imaging, since it can provide high-contrast images by using phase variations.  Among the different existing techniques, Zernike phase contrast microscopy is one of the most popular phase-sensitive techniques for investigating the fine structure of the sample at high spatial resoln.  In X-ray Zernike phase contrast microscopy, the image contrast is indeed a mixt. of absorption and phase contrast.  Therefore, this technique just provides qual. information on the object, which makes the interpretation of the image difficult.  In this contribution, an approach is proposed for quant. phase retrieval in X-ray Zernike phase contrast microscopy.  By shifting the phase of the direct light by π/2 and 3π/2, two images of the same object are measured successively.  The phase information of the object can then be quant. retrieved by a proper combination of the measured images.  Numerical expts. were carried out and the results confirmed the feasibility of the proposed method.  It is expected that the proposed method will find widespread applications in biol., materials science and so on.\n",

      "Full-field transmission hard X-ray microscopy (TXM) has been widely applied to study morphology and structures with high spatial precision and to dynamic processes.  Zernike phase contrast (ZPC) in hard X-ray TXM is often utilized to get an in-line phase contrast enhancement for weak-absorbing materials with little contrast differences.  Here, following forward image formation, we derive and simplify the contrast transfer functions (CTFs) of the Zernike phase imaging system in TXM based on a linear space-shift-invariant imaging mode under certain approximations.  The CTFs in ZPC in their simplified forms show a high similarity to the one in free-space propagation X-ray imaging systems.\n",

      "Using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy the authors have measured the rotational modes of concd. charged gibbsite platelets in the isotropic regime.  This was done by analyzing the data qual. using available theories for noninteracting systems.  The relaxation spectra do not follow the same pattern as for spherical particles at larger wave vectors.  This deviation from the behavior of spherical systems arises from the influence of the rotational modes.  In the isotropic state a pre-transitional peak in the static q-dependent intensity at large q values is discussed.  Probably this peak originates from a strong local alignment between platelets before the actual phase transition takes place.  (c) 2013 American Institute of Physics.\n",

      "Structural distortion and relaxation are central to any liq. flow.  Their full understanding requires simultaneous probing of the mech. as well as structural and dynamical response.  We provide the first full dynamical measurement of the transient structure using combined coherent X-ray scattering and rheol. on electrostatically interacting colloidal fluids.  We find a stress overshoot during the start-up of shear which is due to the strong anisotropic overstretching and compression of nearest-neighbor distances.  The rheol. response is reflected in uncorrelated entropy-driven intensity fluctuations.  While the structural distortion under steady shear is well described by Smoluchowski theory, we find an increase of the particle dynamics beyond the trivial contribution of flow.  After the cessation of shear, the full fluid microstructure and dynamics are restored, both on the structural relaxation timescale.  We thus find unique structure-dynamics relations in liq. flow, responsible for the macroscopic rheol. behavior of the system.\n",

      "Nanostructures have attracted huge interest as a rapidly growing class of materials for many applications.  Several techniques have been used to characterize the size, crystal structure, elemental compn. and a variety of other phys. properties of nanoparticles.  In several cases, there are phys. properties that can be evaluated by more than one technique.  Different strengths and limitations of each technique complicate the choice of the most suitable method, while often a combinatorial characterization approach is needed.  In addn., given that the significance of nanoparticles in basic research and applications is constantly increasing, it is necessary that researchers from sep. fields overcome the challenges in the reproducible and reliable characterization of nanomaterials, after their synthesis and further process (e.g. annealing) stages.  The principal objective of this review is to summarize the present knowledge on the use, advances, advantages and weaknesses of a large no. of exptl. techniques that are available for the characterization of nanoparticles.  Different characterization techniques are classified according to the concept/group of the technique used, the information they can provide, or the materials that they are destined for.  We describe the main characteristics of the techniques and their operation principles and we give various examples of their use, presenting them in a comparative mode, when possible, in relation to the property studied in each case.\n",

      "Abstr.: Nonlamellar lipid-based liq. cryst. (LLC) nanoparticles possessing different internal nanostructures, specifically the 3D-ordered cubosomes (V2 phase) and the 2D-ordered hexosomes (H2 phase), are of increasing interest as drug delivery systems.  To facilitate their development, it is important that we understand their interactions with healthy human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).  To this end, a 3D cells-in-a-tube model that recapitulates the basic morphol. (i.e. tubular lumen) and in vivo microenvironment (i.e. physiol. shear stress) of blood vessels was employed as a biomimetic testing platform, and the bio-nanoparticle interactions were compared with that of the conventional 2D planar cell culture.  Confocal microscopy imaging revealed internalisation of the nanoparticles into HUVECs within 2 h and that the nanoparticle-cell interactions of cubosomes and hexosomes were not significantly different from one another.  Low fluid shear stress conditions (i.e. venous simulation at 0.8 dynes/cm2) were shown to impose subtle effects on the degree of nanoparticle-cell interactions as compared with the static 2D culture.  The unexpected similarity of cellular interactions between cubosomes and hexosomes was clarified via a real-time phase behavior anal. using the synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique.  When the nanoparticles came into contact with HUVECs under circulating conditions, the cubosomes gradually evolved into hexosomes (within 16 min).  In contrast, the hexosomes retained their original internal structure with minimal changes to the lattice parameters.  This study highlights the need to couple cellular studies with high-resoln. analytics such as time-resolved SAXS anal. to ensure that particle structures are verified in situ, enabling accurate interpretation of the dynamics of cellular interactions and potential bio-induced changes of particles intended for biomedical applications.

      "Although the current prodn. of oxide nanoparticles may be modest, the wide range of proposed applications and forecasted growth in prodn. has raised questions about the potential impact of these nanoparticles on the environment and human health.  Iron oxide nanoparticles have been proposed for an increasing no. of biomedical applications although in vitro toxicity depending on the particles coating has been evidenced.  The aim of this study was to examine the potential in vitro cyto- and genotoxicity on human dermal fibroblasts of DMSA-coated maghemite nanoparticles (NmDMSA) as a function of well-defined physicochem. states.  Well-stabilized NmDMSA produced weak cytotoxic and no genotoxic effects.  This is attributed in part to the DMSA coating, which serves as a barrier for a direct contact between nano-oxide and fibroblasts, inhibiting a potential toxic effect.\n",

      "Within the framework of the ESRF Phase I Upgrade Program, a new state-of-the-art synchrotron beamline ID16B has been recently developed for hard X-ray nano-anal.  The construction of ID16B was driven by research areas with major scientific and societal impact such as nanotechnol., earth and environmental sciences, and bio-medical research.  Based on a canted undulator source, this long beamline provides hard X-ray nanobeams optimized mainly for spectroscopic applications, including the combination of X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, X-ray excited optical luminescence, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and 2D/3D X-ray imaging techniques.  Its end-station re-uses part of the app. of the earlier ID22 beamline, while improving and enlarging the spectroscopic capabilities: for example, the exptl. arrangement offers improved lateral spatial resoln. (∼50 nm), a larger and more flexible capability for in situ expts., and monochromatic nanobeams tunable over a wider energy range which now includes the hard X-ray regime (5-70 keV).  This paper describes the characteristics of this new facility, short-term tech. developments and the first scientific results.\n",

It is based on nanofocusing refractive X-ray lenses and is designed for two-dimensional mapping and scanning tomog.  It supports X-ray fluorescence and (coherent) diffraction contrast, yielding elemental and structural information from inside the sample.  Spatial resolns. down to well below 50 nm are aimed for in direct space.  A further increase in spatial resoln. is expected by applying ptychog. scanning schemes.

      "The MISTRAL beamline is one of the seven phase-I beamlines at the ALBA synchrotron light source (Barcelona, Spain) that will be opened to users at the end of 2010.  MISTRAL will be devoted to cryotomography in the water window and multi-keV spectral regions for biological applications.  The optics design consists of a plane-grating monochromator that has been implemented using variable-line-spacing gratings to fulfil the requirements of X-ray microscopy using a reflective condenser.  For instance, a fixed-focus condition independent of the included angle, constant magnification as well as coma and spherical aberration corrections are achieved with this system.  The reported design is of wider use.\n",

      "The Nanoscopium 155 m-long beamline of Synchrotron Soleil is dedicated to scanning hard X-ray nanoprobe techniques.  Nanoscopium aims to reach ≤100 nm resoln. in the 5-20 keV energy range for routine user expts.  The beamline design tackles the tight stability requirements of such a scanning nanoprobe by creating an overfilled secondary source, implementing all horizontally reflecting main beamline optics, applying high mech. stability equipment and constructing a dedicated high-stability building envelope.  Multi-technique scanning imaging and tomog. including X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and spectro-microscopy, absorption, differential phase and dark-field contrasts are implemented at the beamline in order to provide simultaneous information on the elemental distribution, speciation and sample morphol.  This paper describes the optical concept and the first measured performance of the Nanoscopium beamline followed by the hierarchical length-scale multi-technique imaging expts. performed with dwell times down to 3 ms per pixel.\n",

      "Functionalized computed tomog. (CT) in combination with labeled cells is virtually non-existent due to the limited sensitivity of X-ray-absorption-based imaging, but would be highly desirable to realize cell tracking studies in entire organisms.  In this study we applied in-line free propagation X-ray phase-contrast CT (XPCT) in an allergic asthma mouse model to assess structural changes as well as the biodistribution of barium-labeled macrophages in lung tissue.  Alveolar macrophages that were barium-sulfate-loaded and fluorescent-labeled were instilled intratracheally into asthmatic and control mice.  Mice were sacrificed after 24 h, lungs were kept in situ, inflated with air and scanned utilizing XPCT at the SYRMEP beamline (Elettra Synchrotron Light Source, Italy).  Single-distance phase retrieval was used to generate data sets with ten times greater contrast-to-noise ratio than absorption-based CT (in our setup), thus allowing to depict and quantify structural hallmarks of asthmatic lungs such as reduced air vol., obstruction of airways and increased soft-tissue content.  Furthermore, we found a higher concn. as well as a specific accumulation of the barium-labeled macrophages in asthmatic lung tissue.  It is believe that XPCT will be beneficial in preclin. asthma research for both the assessment of therapeutic response as well as the anal. of the role of the recruitment of macrophages to inflammatory sites.\n",

However, such studies are neg. affected by the limitations of imaging techniques in the detection of microscopic blood vessels (diam. 3-5 μm) grown under angiogenic stress.  We report that synchrotron-based X-ray imaging techniques with very high spatial resoln. can overcome this obstacle, provided that suitable contrast agents are used.  Results: We tested different contrast agents based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for the detection of cancer-related angiogenesis by synchrotron microradiol., microtomog. and high resoln. X-ray microscopy.  Among them only bare-AuNPs in conjunction with heparin injection provided sufficient contrast to allow in vivo detection of small capillary species (the smallest measured lumen diams. were 3-5 μm).  The detected vessel d. was 3-7 times higher than with other nanoparticles.  We also found that bare-AuNPs with heparin allows detecting symptoms of local extravascular nanoparticle diffusion in tumor areas where capillary leakage appeared.  Conclusions: Although high-Z AuNPs are natural candidates as radiol. contrast agents, their success is not guaranteed, in particular when targeting very small blood vessels in tumor-related angiog.  We found that AuNPs injected with heparin produced the contrast level needed to reveal-for the first time by X-ray imaging-tumor microvessels with 3-5 μm diam. as well as extravascular diffusion due to basal membrane defenestration.  These results open the interesting possibility of functional imaging of the tumor microvasculature, of its development and organization, as well as of the effects of anti-angiogenic drugs.\n",

      "A review.  Morphometric measurements, such as quantifying cell shape, characterizing sub-cellular organization, and probing cell-cell interactions, are fundamental in cell biol. and clin. medicine.  Until quite recently, the main source of morphometric data on cells has been light-and electron-based microscope images.  However, many technol. advances have propelled X-ray microscopy into becoming another source of high-quality morphometric information.  Here, we review the status of X-ray microscopy as a quant. biol. imaging modality.  We also describe the combination of X-ray microscopy data with information from other modalities to generate polychromatic views of biol. systems.  For example, the amalgamation of mol. localization data, from fluorescence microscopy or spectromicroscopy, with structural information from X-ray tomog.  This combination of data from the same specimen generates a more complete picture of the system than that can be obtained by a single microscopy method.  Such multimodal combinations greatly enhance our understanding of biol. by combining physiol. and morphol. data to create models that more accurately reflect the complexities of life.\n",

      "An app. for sub-nanosecond time-resolved ambient-pressure XPS studies with pulsed and const. wave x-ray light sources is presented.  A differentially pumped hemispherical electron analyzer is equipped with a delay-line detector that simultaneously records the position and arrival time of every single electron at the exit aperture of the hemisphere with ∼0.1 mm spatial resoln. and ∼150 ps temporal accuracy.  The kinetic energies of the photoelectrons are encoded in the hit positions along the dispersive axis of the 2-dimensional detector.  Pump-probe time-delays are provided by the electron arrival times relative to the pump pulse timing.  An av. time-resoln. of (780±20) ps (FWHM) is demonstrated for a hemisphere pass energy Ep = 150 eV and an electron kinetic energy range KE = 503-508 eV.  The time-resoln. of the setup is limited by the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spread related to the electron trajectory distribution within the analyzer hemisphere and within the electrostatic lens system that images the interaction vol. onto the hemisphere entrance slit.  The TOF spread for electrons with KE = 430 eV varies between ∼9 ns at a pass energy of 50 eV and ∼1 ns at pass energies between 200 eV and 400 eV.  The correlation between the retarding ratio and the TOF spread is evaluated by means of both anal. descriptions of the electron trajectories within the analyzer hemisphere and computer simulations of the entire trajectories including the electrostatic lens system.  In agreement with previous studies, the authors find that the by far dominant contribution to the TOF spread is acquired within the hemisphere.  However, both expt. and computer simulations show that the lens system indirectly affects the time resoln. of the setup to a significant extent by inducing a strong dependence of the angular spread of electron trajectories entering the hemisphere on the retarding ratio.  The scaling of the angular spread with the retarding ratio can be well approximated by applying Liouville's theorem of const. emittance to the electron trajectories inside the lens system.  The performance of the setup is demonstrated by characterizing the laser fluence-dependent transient surface photovoltage response of a laser-excited Si(100) sample.

      "We present a picosecond time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (tr-XAS) setup designed for synchrotron-based studies of interfacial photochem. dynamics.  The app. combines a high power, variable repetition rate picosecond laser system with a time-resolved X-ray fluorescence yield detection technique.  Time-tagging of the detected fluorescence signals enables the parallel acquisition of X-ray absorption spectra at a variety of pump-probe delays employing the well-defined time structure of the X-ray pulse trains.  The viability of the setup is demonstrated by resolving dynamic changes in the fine structure near the O1s X-ray absorption edge of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) after photo-excitation with a 355 nm laser pulse.  Two distinct responses are detected.  A pronounced, quasi-static, reversible change of the Cu2O O1s X-ray absorption spectrum by up to ∼30% compared to its static line shape corresponds to a red shift of the absorption edge by ∼1 eV.  This value is small compared to the 2.2 eV band gap of Cu2O but in agreement with previously published results.  The lifetime of this effect exceeds the laser pulse-to-pulse period of 8μs, resulting in a quasi-static spectral change that persists as long as the sample is exposed to the laser light, and completely vanishes once the laser is blocked.  Addnl., a short-lived response corresponding to a laser-induced shift of the main absorption line by ∼2 eV to lower energies appears within <200 ps and decays with a characteristic timescale of 43 ± 5 ns.  Both the picosecond rise and nanosecond decay of this X-ray response are simultaneously captured by making use of a time-tagging approach - highlighting the prospects of the exptl. setup for efficient probing of the electronic and structural dynamics in photocatalytic systems on multiple timescales.\n",

      "The Adaptive Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) is an X-ray imager, custom designed for the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL).  It is a fast, low-noise integrating detector, with an adaptive gain amplifier per pixel.  This has an equiv. noise of less than 1 keV when detecting single photons and, when switched into another gain state, a dynamic range of more than 104 photons of 12 keV.  In burst mode the system is able to store 352 images while running at up to 6.5 MHz, which is compatible with the 4.5 MHz frame rate at the European XFEL.  The AGIPD system was installed and commissioned in August 2017, and successfully used for the first expts. at the Single Particles, Clusters and Biomols. (SPB) exptl. station at the European XFEL since Sept. 2017.  This paper describes the principal components and performance parameters of the system.\n",

      "We have examd. the formation and dissoln. of gels composed of intermediate vol.-fraction nanoparticles with temp.-dependent short-range attractions using small-angle x-ray scattering, x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, and rheol. to obtain nanoscale and macroscale sensitivity to structure and dynamics.  Gel formation after temp. quenches to the vicinity of the rheol. detd. gel temp., Tgel, was characterized via the slowdown of dynamics and changes in microstructure obsd. in the intensity autocorrelation functions and structure factor, resp., as a function of quench depth (ΔT = Tquench - Tgel), wave vector, and formation time tf.  We find the wave-vector-dependent dynamics, microstructure, and rheol. at a particular ΔT and tf map to those at other ΔTs and tfs via an effective scaling temp., Ts.  A single Ts applies to a broad range of ΔT and tf but does depend on the particle size.  The rate of formation implied by the scaling is a far stronger function of ΔT than expected from the attraction strength between colloids.  We interpret this strong temp. dependence in terms of cooperative bonding required to form stable gels via energetically favored, local structures.\n",

      "The entatic state denotes a distorted coordination geometry of a complex from its typical arrangement that generates an improvement to its function.  The entatic-state principle has been obsd. to apply to copper electron-transfer proteins and it results in a lowering of the reorganization energy of the electron-transfer process.  It is thus crucial for a multitude of biochem. processes, but its importance to photoactive complexes is unexplored.  Here we study a copper complex-with a specifically designed constraining ligand geometry-that exhibits metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state lifetimes that are very short.  The guanidine-quinoline ligand used here acts on the bis(chelated) copper(I) center, allowing only small structural changes after photoexcitation that result in very fast structural dynamics.  The data were collected using a multimethod approach that featured time-resolved UV-visible, IR and X-ray absorption and optical emission spectroscopy.  Through supporting d. functional calcns., we deliver a detailed picture of the structural dynamics in the picosecond-to-nanosecond time range.\n",

      "Precise localization of nanoparticles within a cell is crucial to the understanding of cell-particle interactions and has broad applications in nanomedicine.  Here, we report a proof-of-principle experiment for imaging individual functionalized nanoparticles within a mammalian cell by correlative microscopy.  Using a chemically-fixed HeLa cell labeled with fluorescent core-shell nanoparticles as a model system, we implemented a graphene-oxide layer as a substrate to significantly reduce background scattering.  We identified cellular features of interest by fluorescence microscopy, followed by scanning transmission X-ray tomography to localize the particles in 3D, and ptychographic coherent diffractive imaging of the fine features in the region at high resolution.  By tuning the X-ray energy to the Fe L-edge, we demonstrated sensitive detection of nanoparticles composed of a 22 nm magnetic Fe3O4 core encased by a 25-nm-thick fluorescent silica (SiO2) shell.  These fluorescent core-shell nanoparticles act as landmarks and offer clarity in a cellular context.  Our correlative microscopy results confirmed a subset of particles to be fully internalized, and high-contrast ptychographic images showed two oxidation states of individual nanoparticles with a resolution of ~16.5 nm.  The ability to precisely localize individual fluorescent nanoparticles within mammalian cells will expand our understanding of the structure/function relationships for functionalized nanoparticles.\n",

      "A selective method is proposed for the detn. of palladium, gold, and sulfur in catalytic systems, by direct liq. anal. using energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF), under an atm. of helium or air.  This method allows a nondestructive anal. of palladium, rhodium, platinum, and gold nanoparticulate catalysts stabilized by imidazolium propane sulfonate based zwitterionic surfactants, allowing the samples to be reused for catalytic studies.  The signals from palladium, rhodium, platinum, and gold samples in the presence of imidazolium propane sulfonate-based zwitterionic surfactants obtained using EDXRF before (Pd2+, Rh2+, Pt2+, and Au3+) and after (Pd0, Rh0, Pt0, and Au0) formation of nanoparticles are essentially identical.  The EDXRF method is nondestructive and allows detection and quantification of the main components of platinum, gold, rhodium, and palladium NPs, including the surfactant concn., with detection and quantification limits at 0.4-3 mg L-1.  The matrixes used in such samples present no problems, even allowing the detection and quantification of interfering elements.\n",

      "Selenocompounds (SeCs) are promising therapeutic agents for a wide range of diseases including cancer.  The treatment results are heterogeneous and dependent on both the chem. species and the concn. of SeCs.  Moreover, the mechanisms of action are poorly revealed, which most probably is due to the detection methods where the quantification is based on the total selenium as an element.  To understand the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneous cytotoxicity of SeCs and to det. their pharmacokinetics, we investigated selenium speciation of six SeCs representing different categories using liq. chromatog.-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and the cytotoxicity using leukemic cells.  SeCs cytotoxicity was correlated with albumin binding degree as revealed by LC-MS and XAS.  Further anal. corroborated the covalent binding between selenol intermediates of SeCs and albumin thiols.  On basis of the Se-S model, pharmacokinetic properties of four SeCs were for the first time profiled.  In summary, we have shown that cytotoxic SeCs could spontaneously transform into selenol intermediates that immediately react with albumin thiols through Se-S bond.  The heterogeneous albumin binding degree may predict the variability in cytotoxicity.  The present knowledge will also guide further kinetic and mechanistic investigations in both exptl. and clin. settings.\n",

      "X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) is a powerful element-selective tool to analyze the oxidn. states of atoms in complex compds., det. their electronic configuration, and identify unknown compds. in challenging environments.  Until now the low efficiency of wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometer technol. has limited the use of XES, esp. in combination with weaker lab. X-ray sources.  More efficient energy-dispersive detectors have either insufficient energy resoln. because of the statistical limits described by Fano or too low counting rates to be of practical use.  This paper updates an approach to high-resoln. X-ray emission spectroscopy that uses a microcalorimeter detector array of superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs).  TES arrays are discussed and compared with conventional methods, and shown under which circumstances they are superior.  It is also shown that a TES array can be integrated into a table-top time-resolved X-ray source and a soft X-ray synchrotron beamline to perform emission spectroscopy with good chem. sensitivity over a very wide range of energies.\n",

      "A review.  We describe a series of microcalorimeter X-ray spectrometers designed for a broad suite of measurement applications.  The chief advantage of this type of spectrometer is that it can be orders of magnitude more efficient at collecting X-rays than more traditional high-resoln. spectrometers that rely on wavelength-dispersive techniques.  This advantage is most useful in applications that are traditionally photon-starved and/or involve radiation-sensitive samples.  Each energy-dispersive spectrometer is built around an array of several hundred transition-edge sensors (TESs).  TESs are superconducting thin films that are biased into their superconducting-to-normal-metal transitions.  The spectrometers share a common readout architecture and many design elements, such as a compact, 65 mK detector package, 8-column time-division-multiplexed superconducting quantum-interference device readout, and a liq.-cryogen-free cryogenic system that is a two-stage adiabatic-demagnetization refrigerator backed by a pulse-tube cryocooler.  We have adapted this flexible architecture to mate to a variety of sample chambers and measurement systems that encompass a range of observing geometries.  There are two different types of TES pixels employed.  The first, designed for X-ray energies below 10 keV, has a best demonstrated energy resoln. of 2.1 eV (full-width-at-half-max. or FWHM) at 5.9 keV.  The second, designed for X-ray energies below 2 keV, has a best demonstrated resoln. of 1.0 eV (FWHM) at 500 eV.  Our team has now deployed seven of these X-ray spectrometers to a variety of light sources, accelerator facilities, and lab.-scale expts.; these seven spectrometers have already performed measurements related to their applications.  Another five of these spectrometers will come online in the near future.  We have applied our TES spectrometers to the following measurement applications: synchrotron-based absorption and emission spectroscopy and energy-resolved scattering; accelerator-based spectroscopy of hadronic atoms and particle-induced-emission spectroscopy; lab.-based time-resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy with a tabletop, broadband source; and lab.-based metrol. of X-ray-emission lines.  Here, we discuss the design, construction, and operation of our TES spectrometers and show first-light measurements from the various systems.  Finally, because X-ray-TES technol. continues to mature, we discuss improvements to array size, energy resoln., and counting speed that we anticipate in our next generation of TES-X-ray spectrometers and beyond.

      "An ambitious goal in biol. is to understand the behavior of cells during development by imaging-in vivo and with subcellular resoln.-changes of the embryonic structure.  Important morphogenetic movements occur throughout embryogenesis, but in particular during gastrulation when a series of dramatic, coordinated cell movements drives the reorganization of a simple ball or sheet of cells into a complex multi-layered organism.  In Xenopus laevis, the South African clawed frog and also in zebrafish, cell and tissue movements have been studied in explants, in fixed embryos, in vivo using fluorescence microscopy or microscopic magnetic resonance imaging.  None of these methods allows cell behaviors to be obsd. with micrometer-scale resoln. throughout the optically opaque, living embryo over developmental time.  Here we use non-invasive in vivo, time-lapse X-ray microtomog., based on single-distance phase contrast and combined with motion anal., to examine the course of embryonic development.  We demonstrate that this powerful 4-dimensional imaging technique provides high-resoln. views of gastrulation processes in wild-type X. laevis embryos, including vegetal endoderm rotation, archenteron formation, changes in the vols. of cavities within the porous interstitial tissue between archenteron and blastocoel, migration/confrontation of mesendoderm, and closure of the blastopore.  Differential flow anal. separates collective from relative cell motion to assign propulsion mechanisms.  Moreover, digitally detd. vol. balances confirm that early archenteron inflation occurs through the uptake of external water.  A transient ectodermal ridge, formed in assocn. with the confrontation of ventral and head mesendoderm on the blastocoel roof, is identified.  When combined with perturbation expts. to investigate mol. and biomech. underpinnings of morphogenesis, our technique should help to advance our understanding of the fundamentals of development.\n",

      "X-ray phase-contrast microtomog. (XPCμT) is a label-free, high-resoln. imaging modality for analyzing early development of vertebrate embryos in vivo by using time-lapse sequences of 3D vols.  Here we provide a detailed protocol for applying this technique to study gastrulation in Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) embryos.  In contrast to μMRI, XPCμT images optically opaque embryos with subminute temporal and micrometer-range spatial resoln.  We describe sample prepn., culture and suspension of embryos, tomog. imaging with a typical duration of 2 h (gastrulation and neurulation stages), intricacies of image pre-processing, phase retrieval, tomog. reconstruction, segmentation and motion anal.  Moreover, we briefly discuss our present understanding of X-ray dose effects (heat load and radiolysis), and we outline how to optimize the exptl. configuration with respect to X-ray energy, photon flux d., sample-detector distance, exposure time per tomog. projection, nos. of projections and time-lapse intervals.  The protocol requires an interdisciplinary effort of developmental biologists for sample prepn. and data interpretation, X-ray physicists for planning and performing the expt. and applied mathematicians/computer scientists/physicists for data processing and anal.  Sample prepn. requires 9-48 h, depending on the stage of development to be studied.  Data acquisition takes 2-3 h per tomog. time-lapse sequence.  Data processing and anal. requires a further 2 wk, depending on the availability of computing power and the amt. of detail required to address a given scientific problem.\n",

      "A review.  X-rays have been used for non-invasive high-resoln. imaging of thick biol. specimens since their discovery in 1895.  They are widely used for structural imaging of bone, metal implants, and cavities in soft tissue.  Recently, a no. of new contrast methodologies have emerged which are expanding X-ray's biomedical applications to functional as well as structural imaging.  These techniques are promising to dramatically improve our ability to study in situ biochem. and disease pathol.  In this review, we discuss how X-ray absorption, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray excited optical luminescence can be used for physiol., elemental, and mol. imaging of vasculature, tumors, pharmaceutical distribution, and the surface of implants.  Imaging of endogenous elements, exogenous labels, and analytes detected with optical indicators will be discussed.\n",

      "We report super-resoln. fluorescence imaging of live cells with high spatiotemporal resoln. using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM).  By labeling proteins either directly or via SNAP tags with photoswitchable dyes, we obtained two-dimensional (2D) and 3D super-resoln. images of living cells, using clathrin-coated pits and the transferrin cargo as model systems.  Bright, fast-switching probes enabled us to achieve 2D imaging at spatial resolns. of ∼25 nm and temporal resolns. as fast as 0.5 s.  We also demonstrated live-cell 3D super-resoln. imaging.  We obtained 3D spatial resoln. of ∼30 nm in the lateral direction and ∼50 nm in the axial direction at time resolns. as fast as 1-2 s with several independent snapshots.  Using photoswitchable dyes with distinct emission wavelengths, we also demonstrated two-color 3D super-resoln. imaging in live cells.  These imaging capabilities open a new window for characterizing cellular structures in living cells at the ultrastructural level.\n",

      "A review.  Fluorescence nanoscopy uniquely combines minimally invasive optical access to the internal nanoscale structure and dynamics of cells and tissues with mol. detection specificity.  While the basic phys. principles of 'super-resoln.' imaging were discovered in the 1990s, with initial exptl. demonstrations following in 2000, the broad application of super-resoln. imaging to address cell-biol. questions has only more recently emerged.  Nanoscopy approaches have begun to facilitate discoveries in cell biol. and to add new knowledge.  One current direction for method improvement is the ambition to quant. account for each mol. under investigation and assess true mol. colocalization patterns via multi-color analyses.  In pursuing this goal, the labeling of individual mols. to enable their visualization has emerged as a central challenge.  Extending nanoscale imaging into (sliced) tissue and whole-animal contexts is a further goal.  In this Review we describe the successes to date and discuss current obstacles and possibilities for further development.\n",

      "Recent advances in fluorescence super-resoln. microscopy have allowed subcellular features and synthetic nanostructures down to 10-20 nm in size to be imaged.  However, the direct optical observation of individual mol. targets (∼5 nm) in a densely packed biomol. cluster remains a challenge.  Here, we show that such discrete mol. imaging is possible using DNA-PAINT (points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topog.)-a super-resoln. fluorescence microscopy technique that exploits programmable transient oligonucleotide hybridization-on synthetic DNA nanostructures.  We examd. the effects of a high photon count, high blinking statistics and an appropriate blinking duty cycle on imaging quality, and developed a software-based drift correction method that achieves <1 nm residual drift (root mean squared) over hours.  This allowed us to image a densely packed triangular lattice pattern with ∼5 nm point-to-point distance and to analyze the DNA origami structural offset with angstrom-level precision (2 Å) from single-mol. studies.  By combining the approach with multiplexed exchange-PAINT imaging, we further demonstrated an optical nanodisplay with 5 × 5 nm pixel size and three distinct colors with <1 nm cross-channel registration accuracy.\n",

      "Advances in microscopy techniques based on x-rays have opened unprecedented opportunities in terms of spatial resoln., combined with chem. and morphol. sensitivity, to analyze solid, soft and liq. matter.  The advent of ultrabright third and fourth generation photon sources and the continuous development of x-ray optics and detectors has pushed the limits of imaging and spectroscopic anal. to structures as small as a few tens of nanometers.  Specific interactions of x-rays with matter provide elemental and chem. sensitivity that have made x-ray spectromicroscopy techniques a very attractive tool, complementary to other microscopies, for characterization in all actual research fields.  The x-ray penetration power meets the demand to examine samples too thick for electron microscopes implementing 3D imaging and recently also 4D imaging which adds time resoln. as well.  Implementation of a variety of phase contrast techniques enhances the structural sensitivity, esp. for the hard x-ray regime.  Implementation of lensless or diffraction imaging helps to enhance the lateral resoln. of x-ray imaging to the wavelength dependent diffraction limit.\n",

      "A review.  X-ray crystallog. has been central to the development of many fields of science over the past century.  It has now matured to a point that as long as good-quality crystals are available, their at. structure can be routinely detd. in three dimensions.  However, many samples in physics, chem., materials science, nanoscience, geol., and biol. are noncryst., and thus their three-dimensional structures are not accessible by traditional x-ray crystallog.  Overcoming this hurdle has required the development of new coherent imaging methods to harness new coherent x-ray light sources.  Here we review the revolutionary advances that are transforming x-ray sources and imaging in the 21st century.\n",

      "Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent agent of human malaria, undergoes both asexual cycling and sexual differentiation inside erythrocytes.  As the intraerythrocytic parasite develops it increases in size and alters the permeability of the host cell plasma membrane.  An intriguing question is: how is the integrity of the host erythrocyte maintained during the intraerythrocytic cycle? We have used water window cryo X-ray tomography to determine cell morphology and hemoglobin content at different stages of asexual and sexual differentiation.  The cryo stabilization preserves native structure permitting accurate analyses of parasite and host cell volumes.  Absorption of soft X-rays by protein adheres to Beer-Lambert's law permitting quantitation of the concentration of hemoglobin in the host cell compartment.  During asexual development the volume of the parasite reaches about 50% of the uninfected erythrocyte volume but the infected erythrocyte volume remains relatively constant.  The total hemoglobin content gradually decreases during the 48h cycle but its concentration remains constant until early trophozoite stage, decreases by 25%, then remains constant again until just prior to rupture.  During early sexual development the gametocyte has a similar morphology to a trophozoite but then undergoes a dramatic shape change.  Our cryo X-ray tomography analysis reveals that about 70% of the host cell hemoglobin is taken up and digested during gametocyte development and the parasite eventually occupies about 50% of the uninfected erythrocyte volume.  The total volume of the infected erythrocyte remains constant, apart from some reversible shrinkage at stage IV, while the concentration of hemoglobin decreases to about 70% of that in an uninfected erythrocyte.\n",

      "Cellular structures of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were examd. by using hard X-ray tomog.  Since cells are nearly transparent to hard X-rays, Zernike phase contrast and heavy metal staining were introduced to improve image contrast.  Through using such methods, images taken at 8 keV displayed sufficient contrast for observing cellular structures.  The cell wall, the intracellular organelles and the entire structural organization of the whole cells were visualized in three-dimensional at a resoln. better than 100 nm.  Comparison between phase contrast and absorption contrast was also made, indicating the obvious advantage of phase contrast for cellular imaging at this energy.  Our results demonstrate that hard X-ray tomog. with Zernike phase contrast is suitable for cellular imaging.  Its unique abilities make it have potential to become a useful tool for revealing structural information from cells, esp. thick eukaryotic cells.\n",

      "Polyhydroxylated fullerenols esp. gadolinium endohedral metallofullerenols (Gd@C82(OH)22) are shown as a promising agent for antitumor chemotherapeutics and good immunoregulatory effects with low toxicity.  However, their underlying mechanism remains largely unclear.  We found for the first time the persistent uptake and subcellular distribution of metallofullerenols in macrophages by taking advantages of synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) with high spatial resoln. of 30 nm.  Gd@C82(OH)22 can significantly activate primary mouse macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β.  Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown shows that NLRP3 inflammasomes, but not NLRC4, participate in fullerenol-induced IL-1β prodn.  Potassium efflux, activation of P2X7 receptor and intracellular reactive oxygen speciesare also important factors required for fullerenols-induced IL-1β release.  Stronger NF-κB signal triggered by Gd@C82(OH)22 is in agreement with higher pro-IL-1β expression than C60(OH)22.  Interestingly, TLR4/MyD88 pathway but not TLR2 mediates IL-1β secretion in Gd@C82(OH)22 exposure confirmed by macrophages from MyD88-/-/TLR4-/-/TLR2-/- knockout mice, which is different from C60(OH)22.  Our work demonstrated that fullerenols can greatly activate macrophage and promote IL-1β prodn. via both TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, while Gd@C82(OH)22 had stronger ability C60(OH)22 due to the different electron affinity on the surface of carbon cage induced by the encaged gadolinium ion.\n",

In a combination of pseudopolar fast Fourier transform and the oversampling method with an iterative algorithm, equally sloped tomog. makes superior 3D reconstruction to conventional tomog. that has an intrinsic drawback due to the use of equally angled 2D projections.

      "Electron tomog. is currently the highest resoln. imaging modality available to study the 3D structures of pleomorphic macromol. assemblies, viruses, organelles and cells.  Unfortunately, the resoln. is currently limited to 3-5 nm by several factors including the dose tolerance of biol. specimens and the inaccessibility of certain tilt angles.  Here we report the first exptl. demonstration of equally-sloped tomog. (EST) to alleviate these problems.  As a proof of principle, we applied EST to reconstructing frozen-hydrated keyhole limpet hemocyanin mols. from a tilt-series taken with const. slope increments.  In comparison with weighted back-projection (WBP), the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), EST reconstructions exhibited higher contrast, less peripheral noise, more easily detectable mol. boundaries and reduced missing wedge effects.  More importantly, EST reconstructions including only two-thirds the original images appeared to have the same resoln. as full WBP reconstructions, suggesting that EST can either reduce the dose required to reach a given resoln. or allow higher resolns. to be achieved with a given dose.  EST was also applied to reconstructing a frozen-hydrated bacterial cell from a tilt-series taken with const. angular increments.  The results confirmed similar benefits when std. tilts are utilized.\n",

      "Knowledge of the interactions between nanomaterials and large-size mammalian cells, including cellular uptake, intracellular localization and translocation, has greatly advanced nanomedicine and nanotoxicol.  Imaging techniques that can locate nanomaterials within the structures of intact large-size cells at nanoscale resoln. play crucial roles in acquiring this knowledge.  Here, the quant. imaging of intracellular nanomaterials in three dimensions was performed by combining dual-energy contrast X-ray microscopy and an iterative tomog. algorithm termed equally sloped tomog. (EST).  Macrophages with a size of ∼20μm that had been exposed to the potential antitumor agent [Gd@C82(OH)22]n were investigated.  Large nos. of nanoparticles (NPs) aggregated within the cell and were mainly located in phagosomes.  No NPs were obsd. in the nucleus.  Imaging of the nanomedicine within whole cells advanced the understanding of the high-efficiency antitumor activity and the low toxicity of this agent.  This imaging technique can be used to probe nanomaterials within intact large-size cells at nanometer resoln. uniformly in three dimensions and may greatly benefit the fields of nanomedicine and nanotoxicol.\n",

      "A review.  We can learn much about cell function by imaging and quantifying sub-cellular structures, esp. if this is done non-destructively without altering said structures.  Soft X-ray tomog. (SXT) is a high-resoln. imaging technique for visualizing cells and their interior structure in 3D.  A tomogram of the cell, reconstructed from a series of 2D projection images, can be easily segmented and analyzed.  SXT has a very high specimen throughput compared to other high-resoln. structure imaging modalities; for example, tomog. data for reconstructing an entire eukaryotic cell is acquired in a matter of minutes.  SXT visualizes cells without the need for chem. fixation, dehydration, or staining of the specimen.  As a result, the SXT reconstructions are close representations of cells in their native state.  SXT is applicable to most cell types.  The deep penetration of soft X-rays allows cells, even mammalian cells, to be imaged without being sectioned.  Image contrast in SXT is generated by the differential attenuation soft X-ray illumination as it passes through the specimen.  Accordingly, each voxel in the tomog. reconstruction has a measured linear absorption coeff. (LAC) value.  LAC values are quant. and give rise to each sub-cellular component having a characteristic LAC profile, allowing organelles to be identified and segmented from the milieu of other cell contents.  In this chapter, we describe the fundamentals of SXT imaging and how this technique can answer real world questions in the study of the nucleus.  We also describe the development of correlative methods for the localization of specific mols. in a SXT reconstruction.  The combination of fluorescence and SXT data acquired from the same specimen produces composite 3D images, rich with detailed information on the inner workings of cells.\n",

      "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is spreading worldwide and keeps evolving to adapt to antibiotics, causing increasing threats in clinics, which necessitates the exploration of antimicrobial agents for not only killing of resistant cells but also prevention of AMR progression.  However, so far, there has been no effective approach.  We designed lanthanum hydroxide and graphene oxide nanocomposites (La@GO) to confer a synergistic bactericidal effect in all tested resistant strains.  More importantly, long-term exposure of Escherichia coli (AMR) to subminimum inhibitory concns. of La@GO does not trigger detectable secondary resistance, while conventional antibiotics and silver nanoparticles lead to a 16- to 64-fold increase in tolerance.  The inability of E. coli to evolve resistance to La@GO is likely due to a distinctive extracellular multitarget invasion killing mechanism involving lipid dephosphorylation, lipid peroxidn., and peptidoglycan disruption.  Overall, our results highlight La@GO nanocomposites as a promising soln. to combating resistant bacteria without inducing the evolution of AMR.\n",

      "Microscopy has greatly advanced our understanding of biol.  Although significant progress has recently been made in optical microscopy to break the diffraction-limit barrier, reliance of such techniques on fluorescent labeling technologies prohibits quant. 3D imaging of the entire contents of cells.  Cryoelectron microscopy can image pleomorphic structures at a resoln. of 3-5 nm, but is only applicable to thin or sectioned specimens.  Here, the authors report quant. 3D imaging of a whole, unstained cell at a resoln. of 50-60 nm by x-ray diffraction microscopy.  The authors identified the 3D morphol. and structure of cellular organelles including cell wall, vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, granules, nucleus, and nucleolus inside a yeast spore cell.  Furthermore, the authors obsd. a 3D structure protruding from the reconstructed yeast spore, suggesting the spore germination process.  Using cryogenic technologies, a 3D resoln. of 5-10 nm should be achievable by X-ray diffraction microscopy.  This work hence paves a way for quant. 3D imaging of a wide range of biol. specimens at nanometer-scale resolns. that are too thick for electron microscopy.\n",

      "X-ray fluorescence tomog. promises to map elemental distributions in unstained and unfixed biol. specimens in three dimensions at high resoln. and sensitivity, offering unparalleled insight in medical, biol., and environmental sciences.  X-ray fluorescence tomog. of biol. specimens has been viewed as impractical-and perhaps even impossible for routine application-due to the large time required for scanning tomog. and significant radiation dose delivered to the specimen during the imaging process.  Here, we demonstrate submicron resoln. X-ray fluorescence tomog. of a whole unstained biol. specimen, quantifying three-dimensional distributions of the elements Si, P, S, CI, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn in the freshwater diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana with 400-nm resoln., improving the spatial resoln. by over an order of magnitude.  The resulting maps faithfully reproduce cellular structure revealing unexpected patterns that may elucidate the role of metals in diatom biol. and of diatoms in global element cycles.  With anticipated improvements in data acquisition and detector sensitivity, such measurements could become routine in the near future.\n",

      "Synchrotron radiation phase-contrast computed nanotomog. (nano-CT) and two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) nanoscopic X-ray fluorescence (nano-XRF) were used to investigate the internal distribution of engineered cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs) in exposed individuals of the nematode Caenorhabiditis elegans.  Whole nematodes and selected tissues and organs were 3D-rendered: anatomical 3D renderings with 50 nm voxel size enabled the visualization of spherical nanoparticle aggregates with size up to 200 nm within intact C. elegans.  A 20 × 37 nm2 high-brilliance beam was employed to obtain XRF elemental distribution maps of entire nematodes or anatomical details such as embryos, which could be compared with the CT data.  These maps showed Co NPs to be predominantly present within the intestine and the epithelium, and they were not colocalized with Zn granules found in the lysosome-contg. vesicles or Fe agglomerates in the intestine.  Iterated XRF scanning of a specimen at 0° and 90° angles suggested that NP aggregates were translocated into tissues outside of the intestinal lumen.  Virtual slicing by means of 2D XRF tomog., combined with holotomog., indicated presumable presence of individual NP aggregates inside the uterus and within embryos.\n",

      "Trace metals play important roles in normal and in disease-causing biol. functions.  X-ray fluorescence microscopy reveals trace elements with no dependence on binding affinities (unlike with visible light fluorophores) and with improved sensitivity relative to electron probes.  However, X-ray fluorescence is not very sensitive for showing the light elements that comprise the majority of cellular material.  Here we show that X-ray ptychog. can be combined with fluorescence to image both cellular structure and trace element distribution in frozen-hydrated cells at cryogenic temps., with high structural and chem. fidelity.  Ptychog. reconstruction algorithms deliver phase and absorption contrast images at a resoln. beyond that of the illuminating lens or beam size.  Using 5.2-keV X-rays, we have obtained sub-30-nm resoln. structural images and ∼90-nm-resoln. fluorescence images of several elements in frozen-hydrated green algae.  This combined approach offers a way to study the role of trace elements in their structural context.\n",

      "Recent developments in biol. X-ray microscopy have allowed structural information and elemental distribution to be simultaneously obtained by combining X-ray ptychog. and X-ray fluorescence microscopy.  Exptl., these methods can be performed simultaneously; however, the optimal conditions for each measurement may not be compatible.  Here, we combine two distinct measurements of ultrastructure and elemental distribution, with each measurement performed under optimized conditions.  By combining optimized ptychog. and fluorescence information we are able to det. molar concns. from two-dimensional images, allowing an investigation into the interactions between the environment sensing filopodia in fibroblasts and extracellular calcium.  Furthermore, the biol. ptychog. results we present illustrate a point of maturity where the technique can be applied to solve significant problems in structural biol.\n",

      "As a representative transition metal, Fe plays a key role in chem. activities of atm. particulate matter (PM); it is involved in particle-related free radical generation and adverse health effects.  However, limited understanding of the structure and properties of individual micrometer-sized particulates obscures assessing the Fe contribution for chem. activity.  This work describes multi-dimensional anal. strategies to characterize mass, spatial distribution, and chem. forms of Fe in single haze particles using synchrotron radiation techniques.  X-ray fluorescence imaging quantified the masses of multiple metals and yielded transition metals distribution maps which revealed the types of elements which tend to occur together.  Nano-computed tomog. assessed the Fe spatial distribution, observing Fe exists as small aggregates and is concd. primarily in subsurface regions.  X-ray absorption near structures were combined with scanning transmission x-ray microscopy to quantify ferrous and ferric forms and mapped their distributions in individual particles, to probably attribute Fe chem. activity.  This work demonstrated the power of synchrotron radiation-based techniques to examine inaccessible chem. information in single haze particles, which may provide important clues about Fe chem. as a source of Fenton reactions and health effects.  Multi-faceted anal. approaches exhibited high sensitivity (sub-femtogram/particle or ∼0.2 fg/μm2) for multiple elements and are promising to study other concepts, e.g., aerosol Fe soly., heterogeneous org. matter and SO2 oxidn., and haze particle formation and aging.\n",

      "This study addresses the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of 15-nm gold nanoparticles (NPs), either plain (i.e., stabilized with citrate) or coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), exposed to human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) at the air-liq. interface for 1, 4, and 24 h.  Quant. anal. by stereol. on transmission electron microscopy images reveals a significant, nonrandom intracellular distribution for both NP types.  No particles are obsd. in the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, or golgi.  The cytosol is not a preferred cellular compartment for both NP types, although significantly more PEG-coated than citrate-stabilized NPs are present there.  The preferred particle localizations are vesicles of different sizes (<150, 150-1000, >1000 nm).  This is obsd. for both NP types and indicates a predominant uptake by endocytosis.  Subsequent inhibition of caveolin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) results in a significant redn. of intracellular NPs.  The inhibition, however, is more pronounced for PEG-coated than citrate-stabilized NPs.  The latter are mostly found in larger vesicles; therefore, they are potentially taken up by macropinocytosis, which is not inhibited by MβCD.  With prolonged exposure times, both NPs are preferentially localized in larger-sized intracellular vesicles such as lysosomes, thus indicating intracellular particle trafficking.  This quant. evaluation reveals that NP surface coatings modulate endocytotic uptake pathways and cellular NP trafficking.  Other nonendocytotic entry mechanisms are found to be involved as well, as indicated by localization of a minority of PEG-coated NPs in the cytosol.\n",

      "To visualize the distributions of trace elements in biol. samples such as tissues and cells at high spatial resoln., the authors developed a scanning x-ray fluorescence microscope (SXFM) at SPring-8, using a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror optics that enables achromatic and highly efficient focusing.  To evaluate performance regarding its application to biol. samples, the SXFM was used at x-ray energy of 15 keV to observe NIH/3T3 cells in which ATP synthase β (specifically localized at the mitochondria) were labeled with gold colloidal particles.  Various elemental distributions were visualized at the single-cell level, including those for P, S, Cl, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Au, and high-resoln. elemental distribution maps were obtained by magnifying the labeled single mitochondrion.  Maximum spatial resoln. achieved in the expts. was sub-100 nm.\n",

      "Spatial resoln. defines the phys. limit of microscopes for probing biomol. localization and interactions in cells.  Whereas synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy (XRM) represents a unique approach for imaging a whole cell with nanoscale resoln. due to its intrinsic nanoscale resoln. and great penetration ability, existing approaches to label biomols. rely on the use of exogenous tags that are multi-step and error-prone.  Here, we repurpose engineered peroxidases as genetically encoded X-ray-sensitive tags (GXET) for site-specific labeling of protein-of-interest in mammalian cells.  We fiend that 3,3''-diaminobenzidine (DAB) polymers that are in-situ catalytically formed by fusion-expressed peroxidases are visible under XRM.  Using this new tag, we imaged the protein location assocd. with the alteration of a DNA-methylation pathway with an ultra-high resoln. of 30 nm.  Importantly, the excellent energy resoln. of XRM enables multicolor imaging using different peroxidase tags.  The development of GXET enlightens the way to nanoscopic imaging for biol. studies.\n",

      "We report for the first time seeing and counting integrin αIIbβ3 on a single-cell level.  The proposed method is based on the using of the Au cluster probe.  With the fluorescent property of Au24 cluster and the specific targeting ability of peptide, our probe can directly visualize integrin αIIbβ3 on the membrane of human erythroleukemia cells (HEL) via confocal microscopy.  On the basis of the accurate formula of our probe (Au24Peptide8), the no. of integrin αIIbβ3 can be precisely counted by quantifying the gold content on a single HEL cell via laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  Our results reveal that the no. of integrin αIIbβ3 on a single cell varies from 5.75 × 10-17 to 9.11 × 10-17 mol, because of the heteroexpression levels of αIIbβ3 on individual cells.\n",

      "BACKGROUND:  Comparative, functional, and developmental studies of animal morphology require accurate visualization of three-dimensional structures, but few widely applicable methods exist for non-destructive whole-volume imaging of animal tissues.  Quantitative studies in particular require accurately aligned and calibrated volume images of animal structures.  X-ray microtomography (microCT) has the potential to produce quantitative 3D images of small biological samples, but its widespread use for non-mineralized tissues has been limited by the low x-ray contrast of soft tissues.  Although osmium staining and a few other techniques have been used for contrast enhancement, generally useful methods for microCT imaging for comparative morphology are still lacking.  RESULTS:  Several very simple and versatile staining methods are presented for microCT imaging of animal soft tissues, along with advice on tissue fixation and sample preparation.  The stains, based on inorganic iodine and phosphotungstic acid, are easier to handle and much less toxic than osmium, and they produce high-contrast x-ray images of a wide variety of soft tissues.  The breadth of possible applications is illustrated with a few microCT images of model and non-model animals, including volume and section images of vertebrates, embryos, insects, and other invertebrates.  Each image dataset contains x-ray absorbance values for every point in the imaged volume, and objects as small as individual muscle fibers and single blood cells can be resolved in their original locations and orientations within the sample.  CONCLUSION:  With very simple contrast staining, microCT imaging can produce quantitative, high-resolution, high-contrast volume images of animal soft tissues, without destroying the specimens and with possibilities of combining with other preparation and imaging methods.  Such images are expected to be useful in comparative, developmental, functional, and quantitative studies of morphology.\n",

      "Phase objects are readily imaged through Fresnel diffraction in the hard x-ray beams of 3rd-generation synchrotron radiation sources such as the ESRF, due essentially to the very small angular size of the source.  Phase objects can lead to spurious contrast in x-ray diffraction images (topographs) of crystals.  This contrast can be eliminated through random phase plates, which provide an effective way of tailoring the angular size of the source.  The possibilities of this very simple technique for imaging phase objects in the hard x-ray range are explored exptl. and discussed.  They appear very promising, as shown in particular by the example of a piece of human vertebra, and could be extended to phase tomog.\n",

      "Manganese (Mn) is an essential metal that can be neurotoxic when elevated exposition occurs leading to parkinsonian-like syndromes.  Mutations in the Slc30a10 gene have been identified in new forms of familial parkinsonism.  SLC30A10 is a cell surface protein involved in the efflux of Mn protecting the cell against Mn toxicity.  Disease causing mutations block the efflux activity of SLC30A10, resulting in Mn accumulation.  Detg. the intracellular localization of Mn when disease-causing SLC30A10 mutants are expressed is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity.  Here, using organelle fluorescence microscopy and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) imaging we found that Mn accumulates in the Golgi app. of human cells transfected with the disease-causing SLC30A10-Δ105-107 mutant under physiol. conditions and after exposure to Mn.  In cells expressing the wild-type SLC30A10 protein, cellular Mn content was low after all exposure conditions, confirming efficient Mn efflux.  In non-transfected cells that do not express endogenous SLC30A10, and in mock transfected cells, Mn was located in the Golgi app., similarly to its distribution in cells expressing the mutant protein, confirming deficient Mn efflux.  The newly developed SXRF cryogenic nanoimaging (<50 nm resoln.) indicated that Mn was trapped in single vesicles within the Golgi app.  Our results confirm the role of SLC30A10 in Mn efflux and the accumulation of Mn in cells expressing the disease causing SLC30A10-Δ105-107 mutation.  Moreover, we identified suborganelle Golgi nanovesicles as the main compartment of Mn accumulation in SLC30A10 mutants suggesting interactions with the vesicular trafficking machinery as a cause of the disease.\n",

      "Sequestration within the cytoplasm often limits the efficacy of therapeutic nanoparticles that have specific subcellular targets.  To allow for both cellular and subcellular nanoparticle delivery, we have created epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted Fe3O4@TiO2 nanoparticles that use the native intracellular trafficking of EGFR to improve internalization and nuclear translocation in EGFR-expressing HeLa cells.  While bound to EGFR, these nanoparticles do not interfere with the interaction between EGFR and karyopherin-β, a protein that is crit. for the translocation of ligand-bound EGFR to the nucleus.  Thus, a portion of the EGFR-targeted nanoparticles taken up by the cells also reaches cell nuclei.  We were able to track nanoparticle accumulation in cells by flow cytometry and nanoparticle subcellular distribution by confocal fluorescent microscopy indirectly, using fluorescently labeled nanoparticles.  More importantly, we imaged and quantified intracellular nanoparticles directly, by their elemental signatures, using X-ray fluorescence microscopy at the Bionanoprobe, the first instrument of its kind in the world.  The Bionanoprobe can focus hard X-rays down to a 30 nm spot size to map the positions of chem. elements tomog. within whole frozen-hydrated cells.  Finally, we show that photoactivation of targeted nanoparticles in cell nuclei, dependent on successful EGFR nuclear accumulation, induces significantly more double-stranded DNA breaks than photoactivation of nanoparticles that remain exclusively in the cytoplasm.\n",

      "X-ray tomography at the level of single biological cells is possible in a low-dose regime, based on full-field holographic recordings, with phase contrast originating from free-space wave propagation.  Building upon recent progress in cellular imaging based on the illumination by quasi-point sources provided by X-ray waveguides, here this approach is extended in several ways.  First, the phase-retrieval algorithms are extended by an optimized deterministic inversion, based on a multi-distance recording.  Second, different advanced forms of iterative phase retrieval are used, operational for single-distance and multi-distance recordings.  Results are compared for several different preparations of macrophage cells, for different staining and labelling.  As a result, it is shown that phase retrieval is no longer a bottleneck for holographic imaging of cells, and how advanced schemes can be implemented to cope also with high noise and inconsistencies in the data.\n",

      "However, the effects of different methods of exposure on their translocation, biosafety, and biotransformation-related degradability remain unclear.  In this study, we combined the advantages of synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and high-resoln. single-cell SR transmission X-ray microscopy (SR-TXM) with traditional anal. techniques to investigate translocation, precise degraded species/ratio, and correlation between the degrdn. and toxicity levels of polyvinylpyrrolidone-modified 2H-phase MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2-PVP NSs).  These NSs demonstrated different biodegradability levels in biomicroenvironments with H2O2, catalase, and human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) (H2O2 < catalase < hMPO).  The effects of NSs and their biodegraded byproducts on cell viability and 3D translocation at the single-cell level were also assessed.  After i.g. administration, NSs accumulated in the gastrointestinal organs and were excreted from feces within 48 h.  After i.v. injection, NSs showed noticeable clearance due to their decreased accumulation in the liver and spleen within 30 days when compared with that in the i.p. group, which exhibited slight accumulation in the spleen.  This work paves the way for understanding the biol. behaviors of nano-MoS2 using SR techniques that provide more opportunities for future applications.\n",

      "We have performed x-ray phase-contrast tomog. on mouse lung tissue.  Using a divergent x-ray beam generated by nanoscale focusing, we used zoom tomog. to produce three-dimensional reconstructions with selectable magnification, resoln., and field of view.  Thus, macroscopic tissue samples extending over several mm can be studied in sub-cellular-level structural detail.  The zoom capability and, in particular, the high dose efficiency are enabled by the near-perfect exit wavefront of an optimized x-ray waveguide channel.  In combination with suitable phase-retrieval algorithms, challenging radiation-sensitive and low-contrast samples can be reconstructed with minimal artifacts.  The dose efficiency of the method is demonstrated by the reconstruction of living macrophages both with and without phagocytized contrast agents.  We also used zoom tomog. to visualize barium-labeled macrophages in the context of morphol. structures in asthmatic and healthy mouse lung tissue one day after intratracheal application.  The three-dimensional reconstructions showed that the macrophages predominantly localized to the alveoli, but they were also found in bronchial walls, indicating that these cells might be able to migrate from the lumen of the bronchi through the epithelium.\n",

      "The degenerative effects of multiple sclerosis at the level of the vascular and neuronal networks in the central nervous system are currently the object of intensive investigation.  Preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for multiple sclerosis, but the neuropathology of specific lesions in EAE and the effects of MSC treatment are under debate.  Because conventional imaging techniques entail protocols that alter the tissues, limiting the reliability of the results, we have used non-invasive X-ray phase-contrast tomography to obtain an unprecedented direct 3D characterization of EAE lesions at micro-to-nano scales, with simultaneous imaging of the vascular and neuronal networks.  We reveal EAE-mediated alterations down to the capillary network.  Our findings shed light on how the disease and MSC treatment affect the tissues, and promote X-ray phase-contrast tomography as a powerful tool for studying neurovascular diseases and monitoring advanced therapies.\n",

      "Studies of brain cytoarchitecture in mammals are routinely performed by serial sectioning of the specimen and staining of the sections.  The procedure is labor-intensive and the 3D architecture can only be determined after aligning individual 2D sections, leading to a reconstructed volume with non-isotropic resolution.  Propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast tomography offers a unique potential for high-resolution 3D imaging of intact biological specimen due to the high penetration depth and potential resolution.  We here show that even compact laboratory CT at an optimized liquid-metal jet microfocus source combined with suitable phase-retrieval algorithms and a novel tissue preparation can provide cellular and subcellular resolution in millimeter sized samples of mouse brain.  We removed water and lipids from entire mouse brains and measured the remaining dry tissue matrix in air, lowering absorption but increasing phase contrast.  We present single-cell resolution images of mouse brain cytoarchitecture and show that axons can be revealed in myelinated fiber bundles.  In contrast to optical 3D techniques our approach does neither require staining of cells nor tissue clearing, procedures that are increasingly difficult to apply with increasing sample and brain sizes.  The approach thus opens a novel route for high-resolution high-throughput studies of brain architecture in mammals.\n",

      "To quantitatively evaluate brain tissue and its corresponding function, knowledge of the 3D cellular distribution is essential.  The gold standard to obtain this information is histology, a destructive and labor-intensive technique where the specimen is sliced and examined under a light microscope, providing 3D information at nonisotropic resolution.  To overcome the limitations of conventional histology, we use phase-contrast X-ray tomography with optimized optics, reconstruction, and image analysis, both at a dedicated synchrotron radiation endstation, which we have equipped with X-ray waveguide optics for coherence and wavefront filtering, and at a compact laboratory source.  As a proof-of-concept demonstration we probe the 3D cytoarchitecture in millimeter-sized punches of unstained human cerebellum embedded in paraffin and show that isotropic subcellular resolution can be reached at both setups throughout the specimen.  To enable a quantitative analysis of the reconstructed data, we demonstrate automatic cell segmentation and localization of over 1 million neurons within the cerebellar cortex.  This allows for the analysis of the spatial organization and correlation of cells in all dimensions by borrowing concepts from condensed-matter physics, indicating a strong short-range order and local clustering of the cells in the granular layer.  By quantification of 3D neuronal \"packing,\" we can hence shed light on how the human cerebellum accommodates 80% of the total neurons in the brain in only 10% of its volume.  In addition, we show that the distribution of neighboring neurons in the granular layer is anisotropic with respect to the Purkinje cell dendrites.\n",

      "Purpose: We present a phase-contrast x-ray tomography study of wild type C57BL/6 mouse hearts as a nondestructive approach to the microanatomy on the scale of the entire excised organ.  Based on the partial coherence at a home-built phase-contrast [Formula: see text] setup installed at a liquid metal jet source, we exploit phase retrieval and hence achieve superior image quality for heart tissue, almost comparable to previous synchrotron data on the whole organ scale.  Approach: In our work, different embedding methods and heavy metal-based stains have been explored.  From the tomographic reconstructions, quantitative structural parameters describing the three-dimensional (3-D) architecture have been derived by two different fiber tracking algorithms.  The first algorithm is based on the local gradient of the reconstructed electron density.  By performing a principal component analysis on the local structure-tensor of small subvolumes, the dominant direction inside the volume can be determined.  In addition to this approach, which is already well established for heart tissue, we have implemented and tested an algorithm that is based on a local 3-D Fourier transform.  Results: We showed that the choice of sample preparation influences the 3-D structure of the tissue, not only in terms of contrast but also with respect to the structural preservation.  A heart prepared with the evaporation-of-solvent method was used to compare both algorithms.  The results of structural orientation were very similar for both approaches.  In addition to the determination of the fiber orientation, the degree of filament alignment and local thickness of single muscle fiber bundles were obtained using the Fourier-based approach.  Conclusions: Phase-contrast x-ray tomography allows for investigating the structure of heart tissue with an isotropic resolution below [Formula: see text] .  The fact that this is possible with compact laboratory instrumentation opens up new opportunities for screening samples and optimizing sample preparation, also prior to synchrotron beamtimes.  Further, results from the structural analysis can help in understanding cardiovascular diseases or can be used to improve computational models of the heart.\n",

      "Cerebral ischemia is associated with a lack of oxygen and high-energy phosphates within the brain tissue, leading to irreversible cell injury.  Visualizing these cellular injuries has long been a focus of experimental stroke research with application of immunohistochemistry as one of the standard approaches.  It is, however, a destructive imaging technique with non-isotropic resolution, as only the two-dimensional tissue structure of a thin brain section is visualized using optical microscopy and specific stainings.  Herein, we extend the structural analysis of mouse brain tissue after cerebral ischemia to the third dimension via microfocus computed tomography (μ-CT).  Contrast of the weakly absorbing unstained brain tissue is enhanced by phase contrast.  We show that recordings at two different magnifications and fields of view can be combined as a single approach for visualization of the associated structural alterations at isotropic resolution, from the level of the whole organ down to single cells.\n",

      "This article presents scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) expts. on the actomyosin assemblies in freeze-dried neo-natal rat cardiac muscle cells.  By scanning the cells through a sub-micrometre focused beam, the local structure and filament orientation can be probed and quantified.  To this end, SAXS data were recorded and analyzed directly in reciprocal space to generate maps of different structural parameters (scanning SAXS).  The scanning SAXS expts. were complemented by full-field holog. imaging of the projected electron d., following a slight rearrangement of the instrumental setup.  It is shown that X-ray holog. is ideally suited to complete missing scattering data at low momentum transfer in the structure factor, extending the covered range of spatial frequencies by two orders of magnitude.  Regions of interest for scanning can be easily selected on the basis of the electron d. maps.  Finally, the combination of scanning SAXS and holog. allows for a direct verification of possible radiation-induced structural changes in the cell.\n",

      "We analyze the signal and noise propagation of differential phase-contrast computed tomography (PCT) compared with conventional attenuation-based computed tomography (CT) from a theoretical point of view.  This work focuses on grating-based differential phase-contrast imaging.  A mathematical framework is derived that is able to analytically predict the relative performance of both imaging techniques in the sense of the relative contrast-to-noise ratio for the contrast of any two materials.  Two fundamentally different properties of PCT compared with CT are identified.  First, the noise power spectra show qualitatively different characteristics implying a resolution-dependent performance ratio.  The break-even point is derived analytically as a function of system parameters such as geometry and visibility.  A superior performance of PCT compared with CT can only be achieved at a sufficiently high spatial resolution.  Second, due to periodicity of phase information which is non-ambiguous only in a bounded interval statistical phase wrapping can occur.  This effect causes a collapse of information propagation for low signals which limits the applicability of phase-contrast imaging at low dose.\n",

      "We report the synthesis, characterization, and utilization of gadolinum-loaded dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Gd-Au DENPs) for dual mode computed tomog. (CT)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging applications.  In this study, amine-terminated generation five poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (G5.NH2) modified with gadolinium (Gd) chelator and polyethylene glycol (PEG) monomethyl ether were used as templates to synthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).  Followed by sequential chelation of Gd(III) and acetylation of the remaining dendrimer terminal amine groups, multifunctional Gd-Au DENPs were formed.  The formed Gd-Au DENPs were characterized via different techniques.  We show that the formed Gd-Au DENPs are colloidally stable and non-cytotoxic at an Au concn. up to 50 μm.  With the coexistence of two radiodense imaging elements of AuNPs and Gd(III) within one NP system, the formed Gd-Au DENPs display both r1 relaxivity for MR imaging mode and X-ray attenuation property for CT imaging mode, which enables CT/MR dual mode imaging of the heart, liver, kidney, and bladder of rat or mouse within a time frame of 45 min.  Furthermore, in vivo biodistribution studies reveal that the Gd-Au DENPs have an extended blood circulation time and can be cleared from the major organs within 24 h.  The strategy to use facile dendrimer technol. to design dual mode contrast agents may be extended to prep. multifunctional platforms for targeted multimode mol. imaging of various biol. systems.\n",

      "As an intensely studied computed tomog. (CT) contrast agent, gold nanoparticle has been suggested to be combined with fluorescence imaging modality to offset the low sensitivity of CT.  However, the strong quenching of gold nanoparticle on fluorescent dyes requires complicated design and shielding to overcome.  Herein, we report a unique nanoprobe (M-NPAPF-Au) co-loading an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) red dye and gold nanoparticles into DSPE-PEG2000 micelles for dual-modal fluorescence/CT imaging.  The nanoprobe was prepd. based on a facile method of \"one-pot ultrasonic emulsification\".  Surprisingly, in the micelles system, fluorescence dye (NPAPF) efficiently overcame the strong fluorescence quenching of shielding-free gold nanoparticles and retained the crucial AIE feature.  In vivo studies demonstrated the nanoprobe had superior tumor-targeting ability, excellent fluorescence and CT imaging effects.  The totality of present studies clearly indicates the significant potential application of M-NPAPF-Au as a dual-modal non-invasive fluorescence/X-ray CT nanoprobe for in vivo tumor-targeted imaging and diagnosis.\n",

      "Photon-counting CT is an emerging technology with the potential to dramatically change clinical CT.  Photon-counting CT uses new energy-resolving x-ray detectors, with mechanisms that differ substantially from those of conventional energy-integrating detectors.  Photon-counting CT detectors count the number of incoming photons and measure photon energy.  This technique results in higher contrast-to-noise ratio, improved spatial resolution, and optimized spectral imaging.  Photon-counting CT can reduce radiation exposure, reconstruct images at a higher resolution, correct beam-hardening artifacts, optimize the use of contrast agents, and create opportunities for quantitative imaging relative to current CT technology.  In this review, the authors will explain the technical principles of photon-counting CT in nonmathematical terms for radiologists and clinicians.  Following a general overview of the current status of photon-counting CT, they will explain potential clinical applications of this technology.\n",

      "A review.  Spectral photon-counting CT (SPCCT) is an emerging X-ray imaging technol. that extends the scope of available diagnostic imaging tools.  The main advantage of photon-counting CT technol. is better sampling of the spectral information from the transmitted spectrum in order to benefit from addnl. phys. information being produced during matter interaction, including photo-elec. and Compton effects, and the K-edge effect.  The K-edge, which is specific for a given element, is the increase in X-ray absorption of the element above the binding energy between its inner electronic shell and the nucleus.  Hence, the spectral information contributes to better characterization of tissues and materials of interest, explaining the excitement surrounding this area of X-ray imaging.  Other improvements of SPCCT compared with conventional CT, such as higher spatial resoln., lower radiation exposure and lower noise are also expected to provide benefits for diagnostic imaging.  In this review, we describe multi-energy CT imaging, from dual energy to photon counting technol., and our initial experience results using a clin.-scale spectral photon counting CT (SPCCT) prototype system in vitro and in vivo.  In addn., possible clin. applications are introduced.\n",

      "PURPOSE:  To demonstrate the feasibility of spectral imaging using photon-counting detector (PCD) x-ray computed tomography (CT) for simultaneous material decomposition of three contrast agents in vivo in a large animal model.  METHODS:  This Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved study used a canine model.  Bismuth subsalicylate was administered orally 24-72 h before imaging.  PCD CT was performed during intravenous administration of 40-60 ml gadoterate meglumine; 3.5 min later, iopamidol 370 was injected intravenously.  Renal PCD CT images were acquired every 2 s for 5-6 min to capture the wash-in and wash-out kinetics of the contrast agents.  Least mean squares linear material decomposition was used to calculate the concentrations of contrast agents in the aorta, renal cortex, renal medulla and renal pelvis.  RESULTS:  Using reference vials with known concentrations of materials, we computed molar concentrations of the various contrast agents during each phase of CT scanning.  Material concentration maps allowed simultaneous quantification of both arterial and delayed renal enhancement in a single CT acquisition.  The accuracy of the material decomposition algorithm in a test phantom was -0.4 ± 2.2 mM, 0.3 ± 2.2 mM for iodine and gadolinium solutions, respectively.  Peak contrast concentration of gadolinium and iodine in the aorta, renal cortex, and renal medulla were observed 16, 24, and 60 s after the start each injection, respectively.  CONCLUSION:  Photon-counting spectral CT allowed simultaneous material decomposition of multiple contrast agents in vivo.  Besides defining contrast agent concentrations, tissue enhancement at multiple phases was observed in a single CT acquisition, potentially obviating the need for multiphase CT scans and thus reducing radiation dose.\n",

      "A new prototype spectral photon-counting computed tomography (SPCCT) based on a modified clinical CT system has been developed.  SPCCT analysis of the energy composition of the transmitted x-ray spectrum potentially allows simultaneous dual contrast agent imaging, however, this has not yet been demonstrated with such a system.  We investigated the feasibility of using this system to distinguish gold nanoparticles (AuNP) and an iodinated contrast agent.  The contrast agents and calcium phosphate were imaged in phantoms.  Conventional CT, gold K-edge, iodine and water images were produced and demonstrated accurate discrimination and quantification of gold and iodine concentrations in a phantom containing mixtures of the contrast agents.  In vivo experiments were performed using New Zealand White rabbits at several times points after injections of AuNP and iodinated contrast agents.  We found that the contrast material maps clearly differentiated the distributions of gold and iodine in the tissues allowing quantification of the contrast agents' concentrations, which matched their expected pharmacokinetics.  Furthermore, rapid, repetitive scanning was done, which allowed measurement of contrast agent kinetics with high temporal resolution.  In conclusion, a clinical scale, high count rate SPCCT system is able to discriminate gold and iodine contrast media in different organs in vivo.\n",

      "We report a novel mol. imaging agent based on ytterbium designed for use with spectral \"multicolor\" computed tomog. (CT).  Spectral CT or multicolored CT provides all of the benefits of traditional CT, such as rapid tomog. X-ray imaging, but in addn., it simultaneously discriminates metal-rich contrast agents based on the element's unique X-ray K-edge energy signature.  Our synthetic approach involved the use of organically sol. Yb(III) complex to produce nanocolloids of Yb of noncryst. nature incorporating a high d. of Yb (>500K/nanoparticle) into a stable metal particle.  The resultant particles are constrained to vasculature (∼200 nm) and are highly selective for binding fibrin in the ruptured atherosclerotic plaque.  Nanoparticles exhibited excellent signal sensitivity, and the spectral CT technique uniquely discriminates the K-edge signal (60 keV) of Yb from calcium (bones).  Bioelimination and preliminary biodistribution reflected the overall safety and defined clearance of these particles in a rodent model.\n",

Here, we have shown that NanoK achieved the spectral CT contrast required for clin. imaging by incorporating high bismuth loadings in each nanoparticle using organically sol. bismuth compds.  Moreover, the feasibility for bioelimination within 14 days was obsd.  Spectral CT is quant., revealing not only the image of NanoK enhanced pathol. but also providing data on the amt. of bismuth per voxel (i.e., the no. of nanoparticles bound in a given locality), which may become fundamentally important for patient risk stratification and interventional treatment decisions.\n",

      "Computed tomog. (CT) is an X-ray-based medical imaging technique commonly used for noninvasive gastrointestinal tract (GIT) imaging.  Iodine- and barium-based CT contrast agents are used in the clinic for GIT imaging; however, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) imaging is challenging since iodinated and barium-based CT agents are not specific for sites of inflammation.  Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeNP) can produce strong X-ray attenuation due to cerium's k-edge at 40.4 keV but have not yet been explored for CT imaging.  In addn., we hypothesized that the use of dextran as a coating material on cerium oxide nanoparticles would encourage accumulation in IBD inflammation sites in a similar fashion to other inflammatory diseases.  In this study, therefore, we sought to develop a CT contrast agent, i.e., dextran-coated cerium oxide nanoparticles (Dex-CeNP) for GIT imaging with IBD.  We synthesized Dex-CeNP, characterized them using various anal. tools, and examd. their in vitro biocompatibility, CT contrast generation, and protective effect against oxidative stress.  In vivo CT imaging was done with both healthy mice and a dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis mouse model.  Dex-CeNP's CT contrast generation and accumulation in inflammation sites were compared with iopamidol, an FDA approved CT contrast agent.  Dex-CeNP was found to be protective against oxidative damage.  Dex-CeNP produced strong CT contrast and accumulated in the colitis area of large intestines.  In addn., >97% of oral doses were cleared from the body within 24 h.  Therefore, Dex-CeNP can be used as a potential CT contrast agent for imaging GIT with IBD while protecting against oxidative damage.\n",

      "Spectral photon counting computed tomog. (SPCCT) is an emerging medical imaging technol.  SPCCT scanners record the energy of incident photons, which allows specific detection of contrast agents due to measurement of their characteristic X-ray attenuation profiles.  This approach is known as K-edge imaging.  Nanoparticles formed from elements such as gold, bismuth or ytterbium have been reported as potential contrast agents for SPCCT imaging.  Furthermore, gold nanoparticles have many applications in medicine, such as adjuvants for radiotherapy and photothermal ablation.  In particular, longitudinal imaging of the biodistribution of nanoparticles would be highly attractive for their clin. translation.  We therefore studied the capabilities of a novel SPCCT scanner to quantify the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles in vivo.  PEGylated gold nanoparticles were used.  Phantom imaging showed that concns. measured on gold images correlated well with known concns. (slope = 0.94, intercept = 0.18, RMSE = 0.18, R2 = 0.99).  The SPCCT system allowed repetitive and quick acquisitions in vivo, and follow-up of changes in the AuNP biodistribution over time.  Measurements performed on gold images correlated with the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurements in the organs of interest (slope = 0.77, intercept = 0.47, RMSE = 0.72, R2 = 0.93).  TEM results were in agreement with the imaging and ICP-OES in that much higher concns. of AuNPs were obsd. in the liver, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes (mainly in macrophages).  In conclusion, we found that SPCCT can be used for repetitive and non-invasive detn. of the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles in vivo.\n",

      "A review.  Nanotechnol. has become more and more potentially used in diagnosis or treatment of diseases.  Advances in nanotechnol. have led to new and improved nanomaterials in biomedical applications.  Common nanomaterials applicable in biomedical applications include liposomes, polymeric micelles, graphene, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, ferroferric oxide nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), and so on.  Among them, Au NPs have been considered as the most interesting nanomaterial because of its unique optical, electronic, sensing and biochem. properties.  Au NPs have been potentially applied for medical imaging, drug delivery, and tumor therapy in the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases.  This review focuses on some recent advances in the use of Au NPs as drug carriers for the intracellular delivery of therapeutics and as mol. nanoprobes for the detection and monitoring of target mols.\n",

      "Microsynchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (μ-SR-XRF) is an X-ray procedure that utilizes synchrotron radiation as an excitation source. μ-SR-XRF is a rapid, nondestructive technique that allows mapping and quantification of metals and biol. important elements in cell or tissue samples.  Generally, the intratumor distribution of nanocarrier-based therapeutics is assessed by tracing the distribution of a labeled nanocarrier within tumor tissue, rather than by tracing the encapsulated drug.  Instead of targeting the delivery vehicle, we employed μ-SR-XRF to visualize the intratumoral microdistribution of oxaliplatin (l-OHP) encapsulated within PEGylated liposomes.  Tumor-bearing mice were i.v. injected with either l-OHP-contg. PEGylated liposomes (l-OHP liposomes) or free l-OHP.  The intratumor distribution of l-OHP within tumor sections was detd. by detecting the fluorescence of platinum atoms, which are the main elemental components of l-OHP.  The l-OHP in the liposomal formulation was localized near the tumor vessels and accumulated in tumors at concns. greater than those seen with the free form, which is consistent with the results of our previous study that focused on fluorescent labeling of PEGylated liposomes.  In addn., repeated administration of l-OHP liposomes substantially enhanced the tumor accumulation and/or intratumor distribution of a subsequent dose of l-OHP liposomes, presumably via improvements in tumor vascular permeability, which is also consistent with our previous results.  In conclusion, μ-SR-XRF imaging efficiently and directly traced the intratumor distribution of the active pharmaceutical ingredient l-OHP encapsulated in liposomes within tumor tissue. μ-SR-XRF imaging could be a powerful means for estg. tissue distribution and even predicting the pharmacol. effect of nanocarrier-based anticancer metal compds.\n",

      "We applied SR-XRF to visualize the distribution of platinum and other elements in 30 rectal cancer specimens resected from patients who received L-OHP-based preoperative chemotherapy and quantified platinum concn. in the tumor epithelium and stroma, resp., using calibration curves.  The platinum concn. in rectal cancer tissue ranged 2.85-11.44 ppm, and the detection limit of platinum was 1.848 ppm.  In the tumor epithelium, the platinum concn. was significantly higher in areas of degeneration caused by chemotherapy than in nondegenerated area (p < 0.001).  Conversely, in the tumor stroma, the platinum concn. was significantly higher in patients with limited therapeutic responses than in those with strong therapeutic responses (p < 0.001).  Furthermore, multivariate anal. illustrated that higher platinum concn. in the tumor stroma was an independent predictive factor of limited histol. response (odds ratio; 19.99, 95% confidence interval; 2.04-196.37, p = 0.013).  This is the first study to visualize and quantify the distribution of platinum in human cancer tissues using SR-XRF.  These results suggest that SR-XRF anal. may contribute to predicting the therapeutic effect of L-OHP-based chemotherapy by quantifying the distribution of platinum.\n",

      "To improve the prognosis of glioblastoma, innovative radiotherapy regimens are required to augment the effect of tolerable radiation doses while sparing surrounding tissues.  In this context, nanoscintillators are emerging radiotherapeutics that down-convert X-rays into photons with energies ranging from UV to near-IR.  During radiotherapy, these scintillating properties amplify radiation-induced damage by UV-C emission or photodynamic effects.  Addnl., nanoscintillators that contain high-Z elements are likely to induce another, currently unexplored effect: radiation dose-enhancement.  This phenomenon stems from a higher photoelec. absorption of orthovoltage X-rays by high-Z elements compared to tissues, resulting in increased prodn. of tissue-damaging photo- and Auger electrons.  In this study, Geant4 simulations reveal that rare-earth composite LaF3:Ce nanoscintillators effectively generate photo- and Auger-electrons upon orthovoltage X-rays.  3D spatially resolved X-ray fluorescence microtomog. shows that LaF3:Ce highly concs. in microtumors and enhances radiotherapy in an X-ray energy-dependent manner.  In an aggressive syngeneic model of orthotopic glioblastoma, intracerebral injection of LaF3:Ce is well tolerated and achieves complete tumor remission in 15% of the subjects receiving monochromatic synchrotron radiotherapy.  This study provides unequivocal evidence for radiation dose-enhancement by nanoscintillators, eliciting a prominent radiotherapeutic effect.  Altogether, nanoscintillators have invaluable properties for enhancing the focal damage of radiotherapy in glioblastoma and other radioresistant cancers.\n",

      "Fibrous particles interact with cells and organisms in complex ways that can lead to cellular dysfunction, cell death, inflammation, and disease.  The development of conductive transparent networks (CTNs) composed of metallic silver nanowires (AgNWs) for flexible touchscreen displays raises new possibilities for the intimate contact between novel fibers and human skin.  Here, we report that a material property, nanowire-bending stiffness that is a function of diam., controls the cytotoxicity of AgNWs to nonimmune cells from humans, mice, and fish without deterioration of crit. CTN performance parameters: elec. cond. and optical transparency.  Both 30- and 90-nm-diam. AgNWs are readily internalized by cells, but thinner NWs are mech. crumpled by the forces imposed during or after endocytosis, while thicker nanowires puncture the enclosing membrane and release silver ions and lysosomal contents to the cytoplasm, thereby initiating oxidative stress.  This finding extends the fiber pathol. paradigm and will enable the manuf. of safer products incorporating AgNWs.\n",

      "A variety of transition metal complexes exhibit anticancer activity, but their target sites in cells need to be identified and mechanisms of action elucidated.  Here, the sub-cellular distribution of [Os(η6-p-cym)(Azpy-NMe2)I]+ (p-cym=p-cymene, Azpy-NMe2=2-(p-[dimethylamino]phenylazo)pyridine) (1), a promising drug candidate, can be mapped in human ovarian cancer cells at pharmacol. concns. using a synchrotron x-ray fluorescence nanoprobe (SXRFN).  SXRFN data for Os, Zn, Ca, and P, as well as TEM and ICP anal. of mitochondrial fractions suggest localization of Os in mitochondria and not in the nucleus, accompanied by mobilization of Ca from the endoplasmic reticulum, a signaling event for cell death.  These data are consistent with the ability of (1) to induce rapid bursts of reactive oxygen species and esp. superoxide formed in the first step of O2 redn. in mitochondria.  Such metabolic targeting differs from the action of Pt drugs, offering promise for combating Pt resistance, which is a current clin. problem.\n",

      "While the role of microorganisms as main drivers of metal mobility and mineral formation under Earth surface conditions is now widely accepted, the formation of secondary gold (Au) is commonly attributed to abiotic processes.  Here, the authors report that the biomineralization of Au nanoparticles in the metallophillic bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 is the result of Au-regulated gene expression leading to the energy-dependent reductive pptn. of toxic Au(III)-complexes.  C. metallidurans, which forms biofilms on Au grains, rapidly accumulates Au(III)-complexes from soln.  Bulk and microbeam synchrotron X-ray analyses revealed that cellular Au accumulation is coupled to the formation of Au(I)-S complexes.  This process promotes Au toxicity and C. metallidurans reacts by inducing oxidative stress and metal resistances gene clusters (including a Au-specific operon) to promote cellular defense.  As a result, Au detoxification is mediated by a combination of efflux, redn., and possibly methylation of Au-complexes, leading to the formation of Au(I)-C-compds. and nanoparticulate Au0.  Similar particles were obsd. in bacterial biofilms on Au grains, suggesting that bacteria actively contribute to the formation of Au grains in surface environments.  The recognition of specific genetic responses to Au opens the way for the development of bioexploration and bioprocessing tools.\n",

      "Using synchrotron x-ray fluorescence mapping, we have examd. the uptake and localization of org. mercury in zebrafish larvae.  Strikingly, the greatest accumulation of Me and Et mercury compds. was highly localized in the rapidly dividing lens epithelium, with lower levels going to brain, optic nerve, and various other organs.  The data suggest that the reported impairment of visual processes by mercury may arise not only from previously reported neurol. effects, but also from direct effects on the ocular tissue.  This novel approach is a powerful tool for directly investigating the mol. toxicol. of heavy metals, and should be equally applicable to the study of a wide range of elements in developing embryos.\n",

      "The increasing prevalence of tattoos provoked safety concerns with respect to particle distribution and effects inside the human body.  We used skin and lymphatic tissues from human corpses to address local biokinetics by means of synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques at both the micro (μ) and nano (ν) scale.  Additional advanced mass spectrometry-based methodology enabled to demonstrate simultaneous transport of organic pigments, heavy metals and titanium dioxide from skin to regional lymph nodes.  Among these compounds, organic pigments displayed the broadest size range with smallest species preferentially reaching the lymph nodes.  Using synchrotron μ-FTIR analysis we were also able to detect ultrastructural changes of the tissue adjacent to tattoo particles through altered amide I α-helix to β-sheet protein ratios and elevated lipid contents.  Altogether we report strong evidence for both migration and long-term deposition of toxic elements and tattoo pigments as well as for conformational alterations of biomolecules that likely contribute to cutaneous inflammation and other adversities upon tattooing.\n",

      "Advances in nanotechnol. have raised concerns about possible effects of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in the environment, esp. in terrestrial plants.  In this research, the impacts of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were evaluated in hydroponically grown cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plants.  Seven day old seedlings were treated with TiO2 NPs at concns. varying from 0 to 4000 mg L-1.  At harvest, the size of roots and shoots were measured.  In addn., micro X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) and micro X-ray absorption spectroscopy (micro-XAS), resp., were used to track the presence and chem. speciation of Ti within plant tissues.  Results showed that at all concns., TiO2 significantly increased root length (av. >300%).  By using micro-XRF it was found that Ti was transported from the roots to the leaf trichomes, suggesting that trichomes are possible sink or excretory system for the Ti.  The micro-XANES spectra showed that the absorbed Ti was present as TiO2 within the cucumber tissues, demonstrating that the TiO2 NPs were not biotransformed.\n",

      "A REVIEW.  The increased use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in com. products and the continuous development of novel applications, is leading to increased intentional and unintentional release of ENMs into the environment with potential neg. impacts.  Particularly, the partition of nanoparticles (NPs) to waste water treatment plant (WWTP) sludge represents a potential threat to agricultural ecosystems where these biosolids are being applied as fertilizers.  Moreover, several applications of ENMs in agriculture and soil remediation are suggested.  Therefore, detailed risk assessment should be done to evaluate possible secondary neg. impacts.  The impact of ENMS on plants as central component of ecosystems and worldwide food supply is of primary relevance.  Understanding the fate and phys. and chem. modifications of NPs in plants and their possible transfer into food chains requires specialized anal. techniques.  Due to the importance of both chem. and phys. factors to consider for a better understanding of ENMs behavior in complex matrixes, these materials can be considered a new type of analyte.  An ideal technique should require minimal sample prepn., be non-destructive, and offer the best balance between sensitivity, chem. specificity, and spatial resoln.  Synchrotron radiation (SR) techniques are particularly adapted to investigate localization and speciation of ENMs in plants.  SR X-ray fluorescence mapping (SR-XFM) offers multi-elemental detection with lateral resoln. down to the tens of nm, in combination with spatially resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) speciation.  This review will focus on important methodol. aspects regarding sample prepn., data acquisition and data anal. of SR-XFM/XAS to investigate interactions between plants and ENMs.\n",

      "Gold nanoparticles are excellent intracellular markers in X-ray imaging.  Having shown previously the suitability of gold nanoparticles to detect small groups of cells with the synchrotron-based computed tomography (CT) technique both ex vivo and in vivo, it is now demonstrated that even single-cell resolution can be obtained in the brain at least ex vivo.  Working in a small animal model of malignant brain tumour, the image quality obtained with different imaging modalities was compared.  To generate the brain tumour, 1 × 10(5) C6 glioma cells were loaded with gold nanoparticles and implanted in the right cerebral hemisphere of an adult rat.  Raw data were acquired with absorption X-ray CT followed by a local tomography technique based on synchrotron X-ray absorption yielding single-cell resolution.  The reconstructed synchrotron X-ray images were compared with images obtained by small animal magnetic resonance imaging.  The presence of gold nanoparticles in the tumour tissue was verified in histological sections.\n",

      "A review.  Thomson scattering sources with their hard x-ray pencil beams represent a promising candidate to drive high-resoln. X-ray Fluorescence Imaging (XFI).  As XFI is a scanning imaging modality, it specifically requires pencil-beam geometries along with a high beam mobility.  In combination with laser-wakefield acceleration (LWFA) such sources could provide the compactness needed for a future transition into clin. application.  A sufficient flux within a small bandwidth could enable in-vivo high-sensitivity XFI for early cancer diagnostics and pharmacokinetic imaging.  We thus report on a specific all-laser driven source design directed at increasing the photon no. within the bandwidth and opening angle defined by XFI conditions.  Typical parameters of driver lasers and electron bunches from LWFA are utilized and controlled within realistic parameter regions on the basis of appropriate beam optics.  An active plasma lens is implemented for chromatic focal control of the bunch.  Source performance limits are identified and compared to existing x-ray sources with regard to their potential to be implemented in future clin. XFI.\n",

      "FTIR imaging is a label-free, non-destructive method valuably exploited in the study of the biol. process in living cells.  However, the long wavelength/low spatial resoln. and the strong absorbance of water are still key constrains in the application of IR microscopy ex vivo.  In this work, a new retrofit approach based on the use of ZnS hemispheres is introduced to significantly improve the spatial resoln. on live cell FTIR imaging.  By means of two high refractive index domes sandwiching the sample, a lateral resoln. close to 2.2 μm at 6 μm wavelength has been achieved, i.e. below the theor. diffraction limit in air and more than twice the improvement (to ∼λ/2.7) from our previous attempt using CaF2 lenses.  The ZnS domes also allowed an extended spectral range to 950 cm-1, in contrast to the cut-off at 1050 cm-1 using CaF2.  In combination with synchrotron radiation source, microFTIR provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio through the circa 12 μm thin layer of medium, thus allowing detailed distribution of lipids, protein and nucleic acid in the surround of the nucleus of single living cells.  Endoplasmic reticula were clearly shown based on the lipid ν(CH) and ν(C=O) bands, while the DNA was imaged based on the ν(PO2-) band highlighting the nucleus region.  This work has also included a demonstration of drug (doxorubicin) in cell measurement to highlight the potential of this approach. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].\n",

      "Real-time chem. imaging of bacterial activities can facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of biofilm structures and functions.  Synchrotron-radiation-based Fourier transform IR (SR-FTIR) spectromicroscopy can yield high spatial resoln. and label-free vibrational signatures of chem. bonds in biomols., but the abundance of water in biofilms has hindered SR-FTIR's sensitivity in investigating bacterial activity.  The authors developed a simple open-channel microfluidic system that can circumvent the water-absorption barrier for chem. imaging of the developmental dynamics of bacterial biofilms with a spatial resoln. of several micrometers.  This system maintains a 10 μm thick laminar-flow-through biofilm system that minimizes both the imaging vol. in liq. and the signal interference from geometry-induced fringing.  Here the authors demonstrate the ability of the open-channel microfluidic platform to maintain the functionality of living cells while enabling high-quality SR-FTIR measurements.  The authors include several applications that show how microbes in biofilms adapt to their immediate environments.  The ability to directly monitor and map bacterial changes in biofilms can yield significant insight into a wide range of microbial systems, esp. when coupled to more sophisticated microfluidic platforms.\n",

      "Synchrotron radiation Fourier transform IR microspectroscopy (SR-microFTIR) of live biol. cells has the potential to provide far greater biochem. and morphol. detail than equiv. studies using dehydrated, chem.-fixed single cells.  Attempts to measure live cells using microFTIR are complicated by the aq. environment required and corresponding strong IR absorbance by water.  There is also the addnl. problem of the limited lifetime of the cells outside of their preferred culture environment.  In this work, the authors outline simple, cost-effective modifications to a com. available liq. sample holder to perform single live cell anal. under an IR microscope and demonstrate cell viability up to at least 24 h.  A study using this system in which live cells have been measured at increasing temp. has shown spectral changes in protein bands attributed to α-β transition, consistent with other published work, and proves the ability to simultaneously induce and measure biochem. changes.  An addnl. study of deuterated palmitic acid (D31-PA) uptake at different time points has made use of over 200 individual IR spectra collected over ∼4 h, taking advantage of the ability to maintain viable cell samples for longer periods of time in the measurement environment, and therefore acquire greatly increased nos. of spectra without compromising on spectral quality.  Further developments of this system are planned to widen the range of possible expts., and incorporate more complex studies, including drug-cell interaction.\n",

      "A review.  Protein misfolding and aggregation are the hallmark of a no. of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the prion diseases.  In all cases, a naturally-occurring protein misfolds and forms aggregates that are thought to disrupt cell function through a wide range of mechanisms that are yet to be fully unraveled.  Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that is sensitive to the secondary structure of proteins and has been widely used to investigate the process of misfolding and aggregate formation.  This review focuses on how FTIR spectroscopy and spectroscopic microscopy are being used to evaluate the structural changes in disease-related proteins both in vitro and directly within cells and tissues.  Finally, ongoing technol. advances will be presented that are enabling time-resolved FTIR imaging of protein aggregation directly within living cells, which can provide insight into the structural intermediates, time scale, and mechanisms of cell toxicity assocd. with aggregate formation.\n",

      "Over the last few years, FTIR spectroscopy has become a potential anal. method in tissue and cell studies for cancer diagnosis.  This has opened a way towards clin. applications such as a tool that would scan samples to assess the presence or absence of malignant cells in biopsies, or as an aid to help pathologists to better characterize those cells that are suspicious but not diagnostic for cancer.  The latter application has the problem that in order to assess these cells pathologists would have already dealt with stained samples.  Therefore, it is important to understand how staining would affect the spectra of cells.  To this purpose, we have conducted this study in order to clarify, first, how haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Papanicolau (Pap) stainings affect the spectra of single cells and, second, whether FTIR spectroscopy could differentiate between stained lung cancer cells and their normal counterparts.  Furthermore, different cell prepns. (cytospin, and smear) used in cytol. diagnosis were assessed.  Expts. performed using a bright IR source (synchrotron) showed that both H&E and Pap staining induced marked changes in the lipid and amide-II band regions.  Despite this, FTIR spectroscopy of already stained cells is capable of differentiating between lung cancer cells and their normal counterparts.  The clin. applications of this methodol. are discussed.\n",

      "Small-animal physiology studies are typically complicated, but the level of complexity is greatly increased when performing live-animal X-ray imaging studies at synchrotron and compact light sources.  This group has extensive experience in these types of studies at the SPring-8 and Australian synchrotrons, as well as the Munich Compact Light Source.  These experimental settings produce unique challenges.  Experiments are always performed in an isolated radiation enclosure not specifically designed for live-animal imaging.  This requires equipment adapted to physiological monitoring and test-substance delivery, as well as shuttering to reduce the radiation dose.  Experiment designs must also take into account the fixed location, size and orientation of the X-ray beam.  This article describes the techniques developed to overcome the challenges involved in respiratory X-ray imaging of live animals at synchrotrons, now enabling increasingly sophisticated imaging protocols.\n",

      "The complexity of lung diseases makes pre-clin. in vivo respiratory research in mouse lungs of great importance for a better understanding of physiol. and therapeutic effects.  Synchrotron-based imaging has been successfully applied to lung research studies, however longitudinal studies can be difficult to perform due to limited facility access.  Lab.-based x-ray sources, such as inverse Compton x-ray sources, remove this access limitation and opens up new possibilities for pre-clin. small-animal lung research at high spatial and temporal resoln.  The in vivo visualization of drug deposition in mouse lungs is of interest, particularly in longitudinal research, because the therapeutic outcome is not only dependent on the delivered dose of the drug, but also on the spatial distribution of the drug.  An addnl. advantage of this approach, when compared to other imaging techniques, is that anat. and dynamic information is collected simultaneously.  Here we report the use of dynamic x-ray phase-contrast imaging to observe pulmonary drug delivery via liq. instillation, and by inhalation of micro-droplets.  Different liq. vols. (4 μl, 20 μl, 50 μl) were tested and a range of localized and global distributions were obsd. with a temporal resoln. of up to 1.5 fps.  The in vivo imaging results were confirmed by ex vivo x-ray and fluorescence imaging.  This ability to visualize pulmonary substance deposition in live small animals has provided a better understanding of the two key methods of delivery; instillation and nebulization.\n",

The X-ray properties of this source enable time-sequence propagation-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging.  We focus here on non-invasive imaging for respiratory treatment development and physiological understanding.  In small animals, we capture the regional delivery of respiratory treatment, and two measures of respiratory health that can reveal the effectiveness of a treatment; lung motion and mucociliary clearance.

      "Advances in modern interface- and material sciences often rely on the understanding of a system's structure-function relationship.  Designing reproducible expts. that yield in situ time-resolved structural information at fast time scales is therefore of great interest, e.g., for better understanding the early stages of self-assembly or other phase transitions.  However, it can be challenging to accurately control exptl. conditions, esp. when samples are only available in small amts., prone to agglomeration, or if X-ray compatibility is required.  We address these challenges by presenting a microfluidic chip for triggering dynamics via rapid diffusive mixing for in situ time-resolved X-ray investigations.  This polyimide/Kapton-only-based device can be used to study the structural dynamics and phase transitions of a wide range of colloidal and soft matter samples down to millisecond time scales.  The novel multiangle laser ablation three-dimensional (3D) microstructuring approach combines, for the first time, the highly desirable characteristics of Kapton (high X-ray stability with low background, org. solvent compatibility) with a 3D flow-focusing geometry that minimizes mixing dispersion and wall agglomeration.  As a model system, to demonstrate the performance of these 3D Kapton microfluidic devices, we selected the non-solvent-induced self-assembly of biocompatible and amphiphilic diblock copolymers.  We then followed their structural evolution in situ at millisecond time scales using on-the-chip time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering under continuous-flow conditions.  Combined with complementary results from 3D finite-element method computational fluid dynamics simulations, we find that the nonsolvent mixing is mostly complete within a few tens of milliseconds, which triggers initial spherical micelle formation, while structural transitions into micelle lattices and their deswelling only occur on the hundreds of milliseconds to second time scale.  These results could have an important implication for the design and formulation of amphiphilic polymer nanoparticles for industrial applications and their use as drug-delivery systems in medicine.\n",

      "The hydrophobic collapse is a structural transition of grafted polymer chains in a poor solvent.  Although such a transition seems an intrinsic event during clustering of polymer-stabilized nanoparticles in the liq. phase, it has not been resolved in real time.  In this work, we implemented a microfluidic 3D-flow-focusing mixing reactor equipped with real-time analytics, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy to study the early stage of cluster formation for polystyrene-stabilized gold nanoparticles.  The polymer shell dynamics obtained by in situ SAXS anal. and numerical simulation of the solvent compn. allowed us to map the interaction energy between the particles at early state of solvent mixing, 30 ms behind the crossing point.  We found that the rate of hydrophobic collapse depends on water concn., ranging between 100 and 500 nm/s.  Importantly, we confirmed that the polymer shell collapses prior to the commencement of clustering.\n",

      "The microscopic insight into how and why catalytically active nanoparticles change their shape during oxidn. and redn. reactions is a pivotal challenge in the fundamental understanding of heterogeneous catalysis.  We report an oxygen-induced shape transformation of rhodium nanoparticles on magnesium oxide (001) substrates that is lifted upon carbon monoxide exposure at 600 K.  A Wulff anal. of high-resoln. in situ x-ray diffraction, combined with transmission electron microscopy, shows that this phenomenon is driven by the formation of a oxygen-rhodium-oxygen surface oxide at the rhodium nanofacets.  This exptl. access into the behavior of such nanoparticles during a catalytic cycle is useful for the development of improved heterogeneous catalysts.\n",

      "Pt-Rh alloy nanoparticles on oxide supports are widely employed in heterogeneous catalysis with applications ranging from automotive exhaust control to energy conversion.  To improve catalyst performance, an at.-scale correlation of the nanoparticle surface structure with its catalytic activity under industrially relevant operando conditions is essential.  Here, we present x-ray diffraction data sensitive to the nanoparticle surface structure combined with in situ mass spectrometry during near ambient pressure CO oxidn.  We identify the formation of ultrathin surface oxides by detecting x-ray diffraction signals from particular nanoparticle facets and correlate their evolution with the sample's enhanced catalytic activity.  Our approach opens the door for an in-depth characterization of well-defined, oxide-supported nanoparticle based catalysts under operando conditions with unprecedented at.-scale resoln.\n",

      "We have studied the oxidn. of MgO(100) supported Pd nanoparticles in a size range from 4 to 24 nm at 570 K and near atm. pressures.  Our exptl. setup using high-energy x rays allows us to study in situ the oxidn. behavior for different particle sizes under identical exptl. conditions.  We can identify three size regimes with a distinct oxidn. mechanism.  For particles smaller than 5 nm in diam., kinetic barriers for bulk oxide formation are strongly reduced and complete transformation to PdO bulk oxide takes place, epitaxial to the MgO substrate.  Particles with a diam. 5 nm <D < 9 nm undergo continuous shrinkage during oxidn. accompanied by the formation of epitaxial PdO on MgO(100).  For larger particles with D > 9 nm, we observe a complete passivation of the particle surface by a thin polycryst. PdO layer, which prevents further oxidn.  Our expts. demonstrate that particles with a few nanometers in size exhibit a much higher reactivity with oxygen, which is important for the performance of Pd nanoparticles as a CO oxidn. catalyst.\n",

      "Nanoparticle sintering during catalytic reactions is a major cause for catalyst deactivation.  Understanding its at.-scale processes and finding strategies to reduce it is of paramount scientific and economic interest.  Here, we report on the compn.-dependent three-dimensional restructuring of epitaxial platinum-rhodium alloy nanoparticles on alumina during carbon monoxide oxidn. at 550 K and near-atm. pressures employing in situ high-energy grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, online mass spectrometry and a combinatorial sample design.  For platinum-rich particles our results disclose a dramatic reaction-induced height increase, accompanied by a corresponding redn. of the total particle surface coverage.  We find this restructuring to be progressively reduced for particles with increasing rhodium compn.  We explain our observations by a carbon monoxide oxidn. promoted non-classical Ostwald ripening process during which smaller particles are destabilized by the heat of reaction.  Its driving force lies in the initial particle shape which features for platinum-rich particles a kinetically stabilized, low aspect ratio.\n",

      "Using coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (CXDI) as an in situ tool, we detd. the shape and strain state of a platinum nanoparticle with ≈160 nm diam. supported by a strontium titanate substrate.  The expt. was performed at a temp. of 400 K under continuous gas flow conditions of pure Ar and Ar/CO mixts.  The nanoparticle was preselected by SEM (SEM) and postanalyzed by at. force microscopy (AFM).  We obtain a very good agreement between the overall nanoparticle size, shape, and defect structure as detd. by CXDI and AFM.  In addn., we compare the strain state in the nanoparticle near surface region and its bulk: For pure Ar flow, we find a slight compressive strain in the nanoparticle bulk compared to an expansion in the near surface region.  We ascribe the latter to the presence of high index vicinal surfaces.  Our anal. suggests that under mixed Ar/CO flow at 400 K reshaping of the nanoparticle occurred.  New high index facets developed, leading to a stronger lattice expansion, also propagating into the nanoparticle bulk.  Our high-resoln. expts. pave the way for future CXDI expts. under operando catalytic reaction conditions.\n",

      "Bimetallic catalysts can undergo segregation or redistribution of the metals driven by oxidizing and reducing environments.  Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) was used to relate displacement fields to compositional distributions in cryst. Pt-Rh alloy nanoparticles.  Three-dimensional images of internal compn. showed that the radial distribution of compns. reverses partially between the surface shell and the core when gas flow changes between O2 and H2.  Our observation suggests that the elemental segregation of nanoparticle catalysts should be highly active during heterogeneous catalysis and can be a controlling factor in synthesis of electrocatalysts.  In addn., our study exemplifies applications of BCDI for in situ 3D imaging of internal equil. compns. in other bimetallic alloy nanoparticles.\n",

      "Nanocryst. titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) is an important material used in commerce today.  When designed appropriately it can generate reactive species (RS) quite efficiently, particularly under UV illumination; this feature is exploited in applications ranging from self-cleaning glass to low-cost solar cells.  In this study, the authors characterize the toxicity of this important class of nanomaterials under ambient (e.g., no significant light illumination) conditions in cell culture.  Only at relatively high concns. (100 μg/mL) of nanoscale titania did the authors observe cytotoxicity and inflammation; these cellular responses exhibited classic dose-response behavior, and the effects increased with time of exposure.  The extent to which nanoscale titania affected cellular behavior was not dependent on sample surface area in this study; smaller nanoparticulate materials had effects comparable to larger nanoparticle materials.  What did correlate strongly to cytotoxicity, however, was the phase compn. of the nanoscale titania.  Anatase TiO2, for example, was 100 times more toxic than an equiv. sample of rutile TiO2.  The most cytotoxic nanoparticle samples were also the most effective at generating reactive oxygen species; ex vivo RS species generation under UV illumination correlated well with the obsd. biol. response.  These data suggest that nano-TiO2 samples optimized for RS prodn. in photocatalysis are also more likely to generate damaging RS species in cell culture.  The result highlights the important role that ex vivo measures of RS prodn. can play in developing screens for cytotoxicity.\n",

      "Cell lines were exposed either to mixts. of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles, or to a hybrid nanoparticle with gold and iron oxide domain.  In the case of simultaneous exposure to gold and iron oxide nanoparticles, enhanced toxicity as compared to the exposure to only one type of nanoparticles was obsd.  An indication was found that, at equiv. concns., the hybrid nanoparticles may slightly reduce cell viability more strongly than mixts. of both nanoparticle types.  The results suggest that composite nanomaterials, in which different materials are present in particle form, need to be analyzed carefully, as not only the concn. of the resp. but also their arrangement may influence their toxicity.\n",

      "Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) has been widely applied in the physical and biological sciences using synchrotron radiation, X-ray free-electron laser, high harmonic generation, electrons, and optical lasers.  One of CDI's important applications is to probe dynamic phenomena with high spatiotemporal resolution.  Here, we report the development of a general in situ CDI method for real-time imaging of dynamic processes in solution.  By introducing a time-invariant overlapping region as real-space constraint, we simultaneously reconstructed a time series of complex exit wave of dynamic processes with robust and fast convergence.  We validated this method using optical laser experiments and numerical simulations with coherent X-rays.  Our numerical simulations further indicated that in situ CDI can potentially reduce radiation dose by more than an order of magnitude relative to conventional CDI.  With further development, we envision in situ CDI could be applied to probe a range of dynamic phenomena in the future.\n",

      "Colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) are a versatile potential platform for in vivo nanomedicine.  Inside blood circulation, NPs may undergo drastic changes, such as by formation of a protein corona.  The in vivo corona cannot be completely emulated by the corona formed in blood.  Thus, in situ detection in complex media, and ultimately in vivo, is required.  Here we present a methodology for determining protein corona formation in complex media.  NPs are labeled with (19)F and their diffusion coefficient measured using (19)F diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. (19)F diffusion NMR measurements of hydrodynamic radii allow for in situ characterization of NPs in complex environments by quantification of protein adsorption to the surface of NPs, as determined by increase in hydrodynamic radius.  The methodology is not optics based, and thus can be used in turbid environments, as in the presence of cells.\n",

      "We demonstrate the use of a molybdenum-anode-based inhouse small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) setup to study biol. macromols. in soln.  Our system consists of a microfocus X-ray tube delivering a highly collimated flux of 2.5 × 106 photons/s at a beam size of 1.2 × 1.2 mm2 at the collimation path exit and a max. beam divergence of 0.16 mrad.  The resulting observable scattering vectors q are in the range of 0.38 Å-1 down to 0.009 Å-1 in SAXS configuration and of 0.26 Å-1 up to 5.7 Å-1 in wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) mode.  To det. the capabilities of the instrument, we collected SAXS data on weakly scattering biol. macromols. including proteins and a nucleic acid sample with mol. wts. varying from ∼12 to 69 kDa and concns. of 1.5-24 mg/mL.  The measured scattering data display a high signal-to-noise ratio up to q-values of ∼0.2 Å-1 allowing for an accurate structural characterization of the samples.  Moreover, the inhouse source data are of sufficient quality to perform ab initio 3D structure reconstructions that are in excellent agreement with the available crystallog. structures.  In addn., measurements for the detergent decyl-maltoside show that the setup can be used to det. the size, shape, and interactions (as characterized by the second virial coeff.) of detergent micelles.  This demonstrates that the use of a Mo-anode based inhouse source is sufficient to det. basic geometric parameters and 3D shapes of biomols. and presents a viable alternative to valuable beam time at third generation synchrotron sources.

      "The local structural changes in amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP)-based dental composites were studied under isothermal conditions using both static, bulk measurement techniques and a recently developed methodol. based on combined ultra-small angle X-ray scattering-X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (USAXS-XPCS), which permits a dynamic approach.  While results from conventional bulk measurements do not show clear signs of structural change, USAXS-XPCS results reveal unambiguous evidence for local structural variations on a similar time scale to that of water loss in the ACP fillers.  A thermal-expansion-based simulation indicates that thermal behavior alone does not account for the obsd. dynamics.  Together, these results suggest that changes in the water content of ACP affect the composite morphol. due to changes in ACP structure that occur without an amorphous-to-cryst. conversion.  It is also noted that biomedical materials research could benefit greatly from USAXS-XPCS, a dynamic approach. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 2012.\n",

First expts. at synchrotron sources using supported model membranes showed that the microfluidic setup yields a very effective soln. for minimizing background scattering and beam absorption, which are often accompanied by radiation damage of biol. samples.

      "Nanoparticles are known to self-assemble into larger structures through growth processes that typically occur continuously and depend on the uniformity of the individual nanoparticles.  Here, we show that inorg. nanoparticles with non-uniform size distributions can spontaneously assemble into uniformly sized supraparticles with core-shell morphologies.  This self-limiting growth process is governed by a balance between electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals attraction, which is aided by the broad polydispersity of the nanoparticles.  The generic nature of the interactions creates flexibility in the compn., size and shape of the constituent nanoparticles, and leads to a large family of self-assembled structures, including hierarchically organized colloidal crystals.\n",

      "The hydrophobic collapse is a structural transition of grafted polymer chains in a poor solvent.  Although such a transition seems an intrinsic event during clustering of polymer-stabilized nanoparticles in the liq. phase, it has not been resolved in real time.  In this work, we implemented a microfluidic 3D-flow-focusing mixing reactor equipped with real-time analytics, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy to study the early stage of cluster formation for polystyrene-stabilized gold nanoparticles.  The polymer shell dynamics obtained by in situ SAXS anal. and numerical simulation of the solvent compn. allowed us to map the interaction energy between the particles at early state of solvent mixing, 30 ms behind the crossing point.  We found that the rate of hydrophobic collapse depends on water concn., ranging between 100 and 500 nm/s.  Importantly, we confirmed that the polymer shell collapses prior to the commencement of clustering.\n",

      "Finding a synthetic pathway to artificial analogs of nacre and bones represents a fundamental milestone in the development of composite materials.  The ordered brick-and-mortar arrangement of org. and inorg. layers is believed to be the most essential strength- and toughness-detg. structural feature of nacre.  It has also been found that the ionic crosslinking of tightly folded macromols. is equally important.  Here, we demonstrate that both structural features can be reproduced by sequential deposition of polyelectrolytes and clays.  This simple process results in a nanoscale version of nacre with alternating org. and inorg. layers.  The macromol. folding effect reveals itself in the unique saw-tooth pattern of differential stretching curves attributed to the gradual breakage of ionic crosslinks in polyelectrolyte chains.  The tensile strength of the prepd. multilayers approached that of nacre, whereas their ultimate Young modulus was similar to that of lamellar bones.  Structural and functional resemblance makes clay- polyelectrolyte multilayers a close replica of natural biocomposites.  Their nanoscale nature enables elucidation of mol. processes occurring under stress.\n",

      "Nacre-like composites have been investigated typically in the form of coatings or free-standing sheets.  They demonstrated remarkable mech. properties and are used as ultrastrong materials but macroscale fibers with nacre-like organization can improve mech. properties even further.  The fiber form or nacre can, simplify manufg. and offer new functional properties unknown yet for other forms of biomimetic materials.  Here we demonstrate that nacre-like fibers can be produced by shear-induced self-assembly of nanoplatelets.  The synergy between two structural motifs-nanoscale brick-and-mortar stacking of platelets and microscale twisting of the fibers-gives rise to high stretchability (>400%) and gravimetric toughness (640 J g-1).  These unique mech. properties originate from the multiscale deformation regime involving solid-state self-organization processes that lead to efficient energy dissipation.  Incorporating luminescent CdTe nanowires into these fibers imparts the new property of mech. tunable circularly polarized luminescence.  The nacre-like fibers open a novel technol. space for optomechanics of biomimetic composites, while their continuous spinning methodol. makes scalable prodn. realistic.\n",

      "Nature is remarkable at tailoring the chirality of different biomols. to suit specific functions.  Chiral mols. can impart optical activity to achiral materials in the form of the particle's electronic transition frequency.  Herein, the authors used peptides of differing secondary structures (random coil and α-helix) to artificially create optically active chiral gold nanoparticles through peptide-nanoparticle interactions as obsd. by CD spectroscopy.  This interaction produces a CD signal at the plasmon resonance frequency (∼520 nm) of the chiral peptide-nanoparticle complex.  Aggregation of the peptide-coated nanoparticles using metal ions results in a red-shifted plasmonic CD response.  The authors' results suggest that chiroptical properties of nanomaterials can be engineered using peptides.\n",

      "Wide-spread applications of nanoparticles require large-scale fabrication techniques.  Being intrinsically scalable, bottom-up nanoparticle synthesis shows an ever-growing control over particle morphol., enabling even chirally selective shapes.  Significant efforts have been undertaken to refine the synthesis in order to decrease the structural spread of the particles and to purify and maximize the resulting handedness.  So far, imaging technologies such as electron microscopy are mostly used to investigate the quality of the synthesis.  However, for nanophotonic and plasmonic applications, the optical properties are, in fact, key.  In this work, we show that single particle chiral scatterometry holds great potential as a feedback to characterize the (chir-)optical quality of chem. synthesized nanoparticles.  The spectra of single helicoid nanoparticles reveal a diverse set of chiroptical responses with hugely varying abs. chiral asymmetry in spite of the well-controlled morphol. of the particles.  Averaging over the single nanoparticles reproduces the soln. ensemble measurement remarkably well.  This demonstrates that the single particles, despite their morphol. and consequently chiroptical differences, exhibit a clearly pronounced chiral spectral and structural feature.  We find that the g-factor, i.e., the degree of asymmetry of chiral light scattering of single nanoparticles can be up to 4 times larger than that for the ensemble.  This proves that chiral scatterometry can be a highly important optical feedback for bottom-up nanoparticle synthesis as it reveals that the asymmetry of the ensemble soln. can be further increased and maximized by appropriate refinement methods or by postfabrication purifn.\n",

      "The chirality of nanoparticles directly influences their transport and biol. effects under physiol. conditions, but the details of this phenomenon have rarely been explored.  Herein, chiral GSH-anchored selenium nanoparticles (G@SeNPs) are fabricated to investigate the effect of their chirality on their transport and antioxidant activity.  G@SeNPs modified with different enantiomers show opposite handedness with a tunable CD signal.  Noninvasive positron emission tomog. imaging clearly reveals that 64Cu-labeled L-G@SeNPs experience distinctly different transport among the major organs from that of their D-and DL-counterparts, demonstrating that the chirality of the G@SeNPs influences the biodistribution and kinetics.  Taking advantage of the strong homologous cell adhesion and uptake, L-G@SeNPs have been shown here to effectively prevent oxidn. damage caused by palmitic acid in insulinoma cells.\n",

      "Nanoscale biological assemblies exemplified by exosomes, endosomes and capsids, play crucial roles in all living systems.  Supraparticles (SP) from inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) replicate structural characteristics of these bioassemblies, but it is unknown whether they can mimic their biochemical functions.  Here, we show that chiral ZnS NPs self-assemble into 70-100 nm SPs that display sub-nanoscale porosity associated with interstitial spaces between constituent NPs.  Similarly to photosynthetic bacterial organelles, these SPs can serve as photocatalysts, enantioselectively converting L- or D-tyrosine (Tyr) into dityrosine (diTyr).  Experimental data and molecular dynamic simulations indicate that the chiral bias of the photocatalytic reaction is associated with the chiral environment of interstitial spaces and preferential partitioning of enantiomers into SPs, which can be further enhanced by co-assembling ZnS with Au NPs.  Besides replicating a specific function of biological nanoassemblies, these findings establish a path to enantioselective oxidative coupling of phenols for biomedical and other needs.\n",

      "Semiconductors with chiral geometries at the nanoscale and mesoscale provide a rich materials platform for polarization optics, photocatalysis, and biomimetics.  Unlike metallic and org. optical materials, the relationship between the geometry of chiral semiconductors and their chiroptical properties remains, however, vague.  Homochiral ensembles of semiconductor helixes with defined geometries open the road to understanding complex relationships between geometrical parameters and chiroptical properties of semiconductor materials.  We show that semiconductor helixes can be prepd. with an abs. yield of ca 0.1% and an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 98% or above from cysteine-stabilized cadmium telluride nanoparticles (CdTe NPs) dispersed in methanol.  This high e.e. for a spontaneously occurring chem. process is attributed to chiral self-sorting based on the thermodn. preference of NPs to assemble with those of the same handedness.  The dispersions of homochiral self-assembled helixes display broadband visible and nearinfrared (Vis-NIR) polarization rotation with anisotropy (g) factors approaching 0.01.  Calcd. CD (CD) spectra accurately reproduced exptl. CD spectra and gave exptl. validated spectral predictions for different geometrical parameters enabling de novo design of chiroptical semiconductor materials.  Unlike metallic, ceramic, and polymeric helixes that serve predominantly as scatterers, chiroptical properties of semiconductor helixes have nearly equal contribution of light absorption and scattering, which is essential for device-oriented, field-driven light modulation.  Deconstruction of a helix into a series of nanorods provides a simple model for the light-matter interaction and chiroptical activity of helixes.  This study creates a framework for further development of polarization based optics toward biomedical applications, telecommunications, and hyperspectral imaging.\n",

      "The intra- and extracellular positioning of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) can dramatically alter their curative/diagnostic abilities and medical outcomes.  However, the inability of common spectroscopic identifiers to register the events of transmembrane transport denies their intracellular vs. extracellular localization even for cell cultures.  Here we show that the chiroptical activity of DNA-bridged NP dimers allows one to follow the process of internalization of the particles by the mammalian cells and to distinguish their extra- vs intra-cellular localizations by real-time spectroscopy in ensemble.  Circular dichroism peaks in the visible range change from negative to positive during transmembrane transport.  The chirality reversal is associated with a spontaneous twisting motion around the DNA bridge caused by the large change in electrostatic repulsion between NPs when the dimers move from interstitial fluid to cytosol.  This finding opens the door for spectroscopic targeting of plasmonic nanodrugs and quantitative assessment of nanoscale interactions.  The efficacy of dichroic targeting of chiral nanostructures for biomedical applications is exemplified here as photodynamic therapy of malignancies.  The efficacy of cervical cancer cell elimination was drastically increased when circular polarization of incident photons matched to the preferential absorption of dimers localized inside the cancer cells, which is associated with the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and their preferential intracellular localization.\n",

      "Chiral self-assembled nanomaterials with biol. applications have attracted great interest.  In this study, DNA-driven gold-upconversion nanoparticle (Au-UCNP) pyramids were fabricated to detect intracellular microRNA (miRNA) in real time.  The Au-UCNP pyramids are doubly optically active, displaying strong plasmonic CD at 521 nm and significant luminescence in 500-600 nm, and therefore can be monitored by both of them.  CD will decrease while the luminescence intensity increases in the presence of miRNA.  The exptl. results show that the CD intensity had an outstanding linear range from 0.073 to 43.65 fmol/10 μgRNA and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03 fmol/10 μgRNA, whereas the luminescence intensity ranged from 0.16 to 43.65 fmol/10 μgRNA with a LOD of 0.12 fmol/10 μgRNA.  These data indicate that the CD signal is much more sensitive to the concn. of miRNA than the luminescent signal, which is attributed to the strong CD intensity arising from the spin angular momentum of the photon interaction with chiral nanostructures and the plasmonic enhancement of the intrinsic chirality of DNA mols. in the pyramids.  This approach opens up a new avenue to the ultrasensitive detection and quantification of miRNA in living cells.\n",

      "The interactions between chiral nanomaterials and organisms are still challenging and mysterious.  Here, a chiral nanodevice made of yolk-shell nanoparticles tetrahedron (UYTe), centralized with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), was fabricated to induce autophagy in vivo.  The proposed chiral nanodevice displayed a tunable circular dichroism (CD) signal when modified with different enantiomers of glutathione (GSH).  Notably, UYTe showed significant chirality-dependent autophagy-inducing ability after D-GSH-modification because the enhanced oxidative stress and accumulation in living cell.  The activation of autophagy resulted in the reduced intracellular CD intensity from the disassembly of the structure.  The intracellular ATP concentration was simultaneously enhanced in response to autophagy activity, which was quantitatively bio-imaged with the upconversion luminescence (UCL) signal of the UCNP that escaped from UYTe.  The autophagy effect induced in vivo by the chiral UYTe was also visualized with UCL imaging, demonstrating the great potential utility of the chiral nanostructure for cellular biological applications.\n",

      "A review.  Conspectus: Chirality in Nature can be found across all length scales, from the subat. to the galactic.  At the mol. scale, the spatial dissymmetry in the at. arrangements of pairs of mirror-image mols., known as enantiomers, gives rise to fascinating and often crit. differences in chem. and phys. properties.  With increasing hierarchical complexity, protein function, cell communication, and organism health rely on enantioselective interactions between mols. with selective handedness.  For example, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases have been linked to distortion of chiral-mol. structure.  Moreover, D-amino acids have become increasingly recognized as potential biomarkers, necessitating comprehensive anal. methods for diagnosis that are capable of distinguishing L- from D-forms and quantifying trace concns. of D-amino acids.  Correspondingly, many pharmaceuticals and agrochems. consist of chiral mols. that target particular enantioselective pathways.  Yet, despite the importance of mol. chirality, it remains challenging to sense and to sep. chiral compds.  Chiral-optical spectroscopies are designed to analyze the purity of chiral samples, but they are often insensitive to the trace enantiomeric excess that might be present in a patient sample, such as blood, urine, or sputum, or pharmaceutical product.  Similarly, existing sepn. schemes to enable enantiopure solns. of chiral products are inefficient or costly.  Consequently, most pharmaceuticals or agrochems. are sold as racemic mixts., with reduced efficacy and potential deleterious impacts.  Recent advances in nanophotonics lay the foundation toward highly sensitive and efficient chiral detection and sepn. methods.  In this Account, we highlight our group's effort to leverage nanoscale chiral light-matter interactions to detect, characterize, and sep. enantiomers, potentially down to the single mol. level.  Notably, certain resonant nanostructures can significantly enhance CD for improved chiral sensing and spectroscopy as well as high-yield enantioselective photochem.  We first describe how achiral metallic and dielec. nanostructures can be utilized to increase the local optical chirality d. by engineering the coupling between elec. and magnetic optical resonances.  While plasmonic nanoparticles locally enhance the optical chirality d., high-index dielec. nanoparticles can enable large-vol. and uniform-sign enhancements in the optical chirality d.  By overlapping these elec. and magnetic resonances, local chiral fields can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude.  We show how these design rules can enable high-yield enantioselective photochem. and project a 2000-fold improvement in the yield of a photoionization reaction.  Next, we discuss how optical forces can enable selective manipulation and sepn. of enantiomers.  We describe the design of low-power enantioselective optical tweezers with the ability to trap sub-10 nm dielec. particles.  We also characterize their chiral-optical forces with high spatial and force resoln. using combined optical and at. force microscopy.  These optical tweezers exhibit an enantioselective optical force contrast exceeding 10 pN, enabling selective attraction or repulsion of enantiomers based on the illumination polarization.  Finally, we discuss future challenges and opportunities spanning fundamental research to technol. translation.  Disease detection in the clinic as well as pharmaceutical and agrochem. industrial applications requiring large-scale, high-throughput prodn. will gain particular benefit from the simplicity and relative low cost that nanophotonic platforms promise.\n",

      "Surfactant-assisted seeded growth of metal nanoparticles (NPs) can be engineered to produce anisotropic gold nanocrystals with high chiroptical activity through the templating effect of chiral micelles formed in the presence of dissym. cosurfactants.  Mixed micelles adsorb on gold nanorods, forming quasihelical patterns that direct seeded growth into NPs with pronounced morphol. and optical handedness.  Sharp chiral wrinkles lead to chiral plasmon modes with high dissymmetry factors (∼0.20).  Through variation of the dimensions of chiral wrinkles, the chiroptical properties can be tuned within the visible and near-IR electromagnetic spectrum.  The micelle-directed mechanism allows extension to other systems, such as the seeded growth of chiral platinum shells on gold nanorods.  This approach provides a reproducible, simple, and scalable method toward the fabrication of NPs with high chiral optical activity.\n",

      "Chirality at the nanometer scale represents one of the most rapidly developing areas of research.  Self-assembly of DNA-nanoparticle (NP) hybrids enables geometrically precise assembly of chiral isomers.  The concept of a discrete chiral nanostructure of tetrahedral shape and topol. fabricated from 4 different NPs located in the corners of the pyramid is fundamental to the field.  While the 1st observations of optical activity of mixed pyramidal assemblies were made in 2009 (Chen, W.; Nano Lett.2009, , 2153-2159), further studies are difficult without finely resolved optical data for precisely organized NP pyramidal enantiomers.  Here the authors describe the prepn. of a family of self-assembled chiral pyramids made from multiple metal and/or semiconductor NPs with a yield ≤80%.  Purposefully made R- and S-enantiomers of chiral pyramids with 4 different NPs from 3 different materials displayed strong chiroptical activity, with anisotropy g-factors ≤1.9 × 10-2 in the visible spectral range.  Importantly, all NP constituents contribute to the chiroptical activity of the R/S pyramids.  The authors were able to observe 3 different CD signals at 350-550 nm simultaneously.  They correspond to the plasmonic oscillations of Au, Ag, and bandgap transitions of quantum dots.  Tunability of chiroptical bands related to these transitions is essential from fundamental and practical points of view.  The predictability of optical properties of pyramids, the simplicity of their self-assembly in comparison with lithog., and the possibility for polymerase chain reaction-based automation of their synthesis are expected to facilitate their future applications.\n",

      "The emergence of chirality is a central issue in chem., materials science, and biol.  In nanoparticle assemblies, chirality has been shown to arise through a few different processes, but chiral organizations composed of plate-like nanoparticles, a class of material under scrutiny due to their wide applicative potential, have not yet been reported.  We show that ribbons of stacked board-shaped cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanoplatelets (NPLs) twist upon the addn. of oleic acid ligand, leading to chiral ribbons that reach several micrometers in length and display a well-defined pitch of ∼400 nm.  We demonstrate that the chirality originates from surface strain caused by the ligand because isolated NPLs in dil. soln. undergo a transition from a flat to a twisted shape as the ligand coverage increases.  When the platelets are closely stacked within ribbons, the individual twist propagates over the whole ribbon length.  These results show that a ligand-induced mech. stress can strongly distort thin NPLs and that this stress can be expressed at a larger scale, paving the way to stress engineering in assemblies of nanocrystals.  Such a structural change resulting from a simple external stimulus could have broad implications for the design of sensors and other responsive materials.\n",

      "The structural complexity of composite biomaterials and biomineralized particles arises from the hierarchical ordering of inorg. building blocks over multiple scales.  Although empirical observations of complex nanoassemblies are abundant, the physicochem. mechanisms leading to their geometrical complexity are still puzzling, esp. for nonuniformly sized components.  We report the self-assembly of hierarchically organized particles (HOPs) from polydisperse gold thiolate nanoplatelets with cysteine surface ligands.  Graph theory methods indicate that these HOPs, which feature twisted spikes and other morphologies, display higher complexity than their biol. counterparts.  Their intricate organization emerges from competing chirality-dependent assembly restrictions that render assembly pathways primarily dependent on nanoparticle symmetry rather than size.  These findings and HOP phase diagrams open a pathway to a large family of colloids with complex architectures and unusual chiroptical and chem. properties.\n",

      "The effect of chem.-compn. modification on the chiroptical property of chiral org. NH4+ cation-contg. org. inorg. hybrid perovskite (chiral OIHP) is studied.  Varying the mixing ratio of bromide and iodide anions in S- or (R-C6H5CH2MeNH3)2PbI4(1-x)Br4x modifies the band gap of chiral OIHP, leading to a shift of the CD signal from 495 to 474 nm.  An abrupt cryst. structure transition occurs, and the CD signal is turned off when iodide-determinant phases are transformed into the bromide-determinant phase.  To obtain CD in the wavelength range where the bromide-determinant phase is supposed to exhibit chiroptical activity, i.e., <474 nm, S- or R-C12H7CH2MeNH3 with a larger spacer group can be adopted; the CD signal can be further blue-shifted to ∼375 nm.  Here, chem.-compn. modification of chiral OIHP affects the chiroptical properties of chiral OIHP in 2 ways: (1) tuning the wavelength of CD by modulating the excitonic band structure and (2) switching the CD on and off by inducing a cryst.-structure change.  These properties can be used for structural engineering of high-performance chiroptical materials for spin-polarized light-emitting devices and polarization-based optoelectronics.\n",

      "X-ray scanning microscopy relies on intensive nanobeams generated by imaging a highly brilliant synchrotron radiation source onto the sample with a nanofocusing X-ray optic.  Here, using a Gaussian model for the central cone of an undulator source, the nanobeam generated by refractive X-ray lenses is modeled in terms of size, flux and coherence.  The beam properties are expressed in terms of the emittances of the storage ring and the lateral sizes of the electron beam.  Optimal source parameters are calculated to obtain efficient and diffraction-limited nanofocusing.  With decreasing emittance, the usable fraction of the beam for diffraction-limited nanofocusing experiments can be increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared with modern storage ring sources.  For a diffraction-limited storage ring, nearly the whole beam can be focused, making these sources highly attractive for X-ray scanning microscopy.\n",

      "Structural studies in general, and crystallog. in particular, have benefited and still do benefit dramatically from the use of synchrotron radiation.  Low-emittance storage rings of the third generation provide focused beams down to the micrometre range that are sufficiently intense for the investigation of weakly scattering crystals down to the size of several micrometres.  Even though the coherent fraction of these sources is below 1%, a no. of new imaging techniques have been developed to exploit the partially coherent radiation.  However, many techniques in nanoscience are limited by this rather small coherent fraction.  On the one hand, this restriction limits the ability to study the structure and dynamics of non-cryst. materials by methods that depend on the coherence properties of the beam, like coherent diffractive imaging and X-ray correlation spectroscopy.  On the other hand, the flux in an ultra-small diffraction-limited focus is limited as well for the same reason.  Meanwhile, new storage rings with more advanced lattice designs are under construction or under consideration, which will have significantly smaller emittances.  These sources are targeted towards the diffraction limit in the X-ray regime and will provide roughly one to two orders of magnitude higher spectral brightness and coherence.  They will be esp. suited to expts. exploiting the coherence properties of the beams and to ultra-small focal spot sizes in the regime of several nanometers.  Although the length of individual X-ray pulses at a storage-ring source is of the order of 100 ps, which is sufficiently short to track structural changes of larger groups, faster processes as they occur during vision or photosynthesis, for example, are not accessible in all details under these conditions.  Linear accelerator (linac) driven free-electron laser (FEL) sources with extremely short and intense pulses of very high coherence circumvent some of the limitations of present-day storage-ring sources.  It has been demonstrated that their individual pulses are short enough to outrun radiation damage for single-pulse exposures.  These ultra-short pulses also enable time-resolved studies 1000 times faster than at std. storage-ring sources.  Developments are ongoing at various places for a totally new type of X-ray source combining a linac with a storage ring.  These energy-recovery linacs promise to provide pulses almost as short as a FEL, with brilliances and multi-user capabilities comparable with a diffraction-limited storage ring.  Altogether, these new X-ray source developments will provide smaller and more intense X-ray beams with a considerably higher coherent fraction, enabling a broad spectrum of new techniques for studying the structure of cryst. and non-cryst. states of matter at at. length scales.  In addn., the short X-ray pulses of FELs will enable the study of fast at. dynamics and non-equil. states of matter.\n",

      "The PETRA IV project aims at upgrading the present synchrotron radiation source PETRA III at DESY into an ultralow-emittance source.  Being diffraction limited up to X-rays of about 10 keV, PETRA IV will be ideal for three-dimensional X-ray microscopy of biol., chem. and phys. processes under realistic conditions at length scales from at. dimensions to millimetres and time scales down to the sub-nanosecond regime.  In this way, it will enable groundbreaking studies in many fields of science and industry, such as health, energy, earth and environment, mobility and information technol.  The science case is reviewed and the current state of the conceptual design is summarized, discussing a ref. lattice, a hybrid multi-bend achromat with an interleaved sextupole configuration based on the ESRF-EBS design, in more detail as well as alternative lattice concepts.\n",

      "The last decade has seen a renaissance of machine-physics studies and technological advancements that aim to upgrade at least 15 synchrotron light sources worldwide to diffraction-limited storage rings.  This is expected to improve the average spectral brightness and transversally coherent fraction of photons by several orders of magnitude in the soft- and hard-X-ray wavelength range, at the expense of pulse durations longer than ∼80 ps FWHM.  This paper discusses the compatibility of schemes for the generation of sub-picosecond photon-pulse durations in synchrotron light sources with standard multi-bunch user operation and, in particular, diffraction-limited electron optics design.  The question of this compatibility is answered taking into consideration the storage ring beam energy and the constraint of existing synchrotrons' infrastructure.  An alternative scheme for the upgrade of medium-energy synchrotron light sources to diffraction-limited storage rings and the simultaneous production of picosecond-long photon pulses in a high-gain free-electron laser scheme are illustrated.\n",

      "It has been known for decades that the emittance of multi-GeV storage rings can be reduced to very small values using multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattices.  However, a practical design of a ring having emittance approaching the diffraction limit for multi-keV photons, i.e. a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR), with a circumference of order 1 km or less was not possible before the development of small-aperture vacuum systems and other accelerator technology, together with an evolution in the understanding and accurate simulation of non-linear beam dynamics, had taken place.  The 3-GeV MAX IV project in Sweden has initiated a new era of MBA storage ring light source design, i.e. a fourth generation, with the Sirius project in Brazil now following suit, each having an order of magnitude smaller horizontal emittance than third-generation machines.  The ESRF, APS and SPring-8 are all exploring 6-GeV MBA lattice conversions in the imminent future while China is considering a similar-energy green-field machine.  Other lower-energy facilities, including the ALS, SLS, Soleil, Diamond and others, are studying the possibility of such conversions.  Future larger-circumference rings, possibly housed in >2-km tunnels made available by decommissioned high-energy physics accelerators, could have sub-10-pm-rad emittances, providing very high coherence for >10-keV X-rays.  A review of fourth-generation ring design concepts and plans in the world is presented.\n",

      "This article summarizes the contributions in this special issue on Diffraction-Limited Storage Rings.  It analyses the progress in accelerator technol. enabling a significant increase in brightness and coherent fraction of the X-ray light provided by storage rings.  With MAX IV and Sirius there are two facilities under construction that already exploit these advantages.  Several other projects are in the design stage and these will probably enhance the performance further.  To translate the progress in light source quality into new science requires similar progress in aspects such as optics, beamline technol., detectors and data anal.  The quality of new science will be limited by the weakest component in this value chain.  Breakthroughs can be expected in high-resoln. imaging, microscopy and spectroscopy.  These techniques are relevant for many fields of science; for example, for the fundamental understanding of the properties of correlated electron materials, the development and characterization of materials for data and energy storage, environmental applications and bio-medicine.\n",

      "In this paper, the fundamental concepts and equations necessary for performing small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and MD-SAXS analyses were reviewed.  Furthermore, several key biological and non-biological applications for SAXS, MD, and MD-SAXS are presented in this review; however, this article does not cover all possible applications.  SAXS is an experimental technique used for the analysis of a wide variety of biological and non-biological structures.  SAXS utilizes spherical averaging to produce one- or two-dimensional intensity profiles, from which structural data may be extracted.  MD simulation is a computer simulation technique that is used to model complex biological and non-biological systems at the atomic level.  MD simulations apply classical Newtonian mechanics' equations of motion to perform force calculations and to predict the theoretical physical properties of the system.  This review presents several applications that highlight the ability of both SAXS and MD to study protein folding and function in addition to non-biological applications, such as the study of mechanical, electrical, and structural properties of non-biological nanoparticles.  Lastly, the potential benefits of combining SAXS and MD simulations for the study of both biological and non-biological systems are demonstrated through the presentation of several examples that combine the two techniques.\n",

      "Many biol. materials, like bone or wood, are hierarchically organized and optimized at all levels for their specific mech. function.  At the lowest level, these materials are fiber composites, where the fiber direction as well as the size of the individual components varies considerably with position inside a given specimen.  For bone or wood, some of these parameters can be readily obtained by small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) in a position-resolved way.  A scanning-SAXS system based on a pinhole camera with rotating anode and area detector is presented, and first applications to the study of bone and wood are reported.\n",

      "The authors demonstrate a novel, synthetic approach, highly inspired by the architecture of natural bone, to design mech. stable nanocomposites incorporating aligned apatite nanocrystals.  To mimic the nanostructure of natural bone, the authors first combine mol. self-assembly and intermol. crosslinking to creat resilient polymeric matrixes with long-range periodicity; then the authors employ compartmentalized mineral growth via a transient amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) phase for the biomimetic formation of bone-like apatites.  Specifically, Pluronic F127 was modified into its diacrylate deriv. (MF127) so the assembled liq. crystal structures can be chem. crosslinked to form polymd. lquid crystal (PLC).  Expts. showed both the PLC matrix and the composite were degradable, which makes them appealing platforms for designing advanced materials for biomedical applications.\n",

      "A scanning X-ray diffraction study of cardiac tissue has been performed, covering the entire cross section of a mouse heart slice.  To this end, moderate focusing by compd. refractive lenses to micrometer spot size, continuous scanning, data acquisition by a fast single-photon-counting pixel detector, and fully automated anal. scripts have been combined.  It was shown that a surprising amt. of structural data can be harvested from such a scan, evaluating the local scattering intensity, interfilament spacing of the muscle tissue, the filament orientation, and the degree of anisotropy.  The workflow of data anal. is described and a data anal. toolbox with example data for general use is provided.  Since many cardiomyopathies rely on the structural integrity of the sarcomere, the contractile unit of cardiac muscle cells, the present study can be easily extended to characterize tissue from a diseased heart.\n",

Complete SAXS patterns over extended ranges of momentum transfer are reconstructed spatially resolved from volumes inside an extended sample.  Several SAXS standard samples are used to quantitatively validate the method and demonstrate its performance.  Further results on biomedical tissue samples (rat brains) are presented that demonstrate the advantages of the method compared to existing biomedical x-ray imaging approaches.  Functional areas of the brains as well as tumor morphology are imaged.  By providing insights into the structural organization at the nano-level, SAXS-CT complements and extends results obtainable with standard methods such as x-ray absorption tomography and histology.\n",

      "When used in combination with raster scanning, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has proven to be a valuable imaging technique of the nanoscale, for example of bone, teeth and brain matter.  Although two-dimensional projection imaging has been used to characterize various materials successfully, its three-dimensional extension, SAXS computed tomog., poses substantial challenges, which have yet to be overcome.  Previous work using SAXS computed tomog. was unable to preserve oriented SAXS signals during reconstruction.  Here we present a soln. to this problem and obtain a complete SAXS computed tomog., which preserves oriented scattering information.  By introducing virtual tomog. axes, we take advantage of the two-dimensional SAXS information recorded on an area detector and use it to reconstruct the full three-dimensional scattering distribution in reciprocal space for each voxel of the three-dimensional object in real space.  The presented method could be of interest for a combined six-dimensional real and reciprocal space characterization of mesoscopic materials with hierarchically structured features with length scales ranging from a few nanometers to a few millimeters-for example, biomaterials such as bone or teeth, or functional materials such as fuel-cell or battery components.\n",

      "The mech. properties of many materials are based on the macroscopic arrangement and orientation of their nanostructure.  This nanostructure can be ordered over a range of length scales.  In biol., the principle of hierarchical ordering is often used to maximize functionality, such as strength and robustness of the material, while minimizing wt. and energy cost.  Methods for nanoscale imaging provide direct visual access to the ultrastructure (nanoscale structure that is too small to be imaged using light microscopy), but the field of view is limited and does not easily allow a full correlative study of changes in the ultrastructure over a macroscopic sample.  Other methods of probing ultrastructure ordering, such as small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons, can be applied to macroscopic samples; however, these scattering methods remain constrained to two-dimensional specimens or to isotropically oriented ultrastructures.  These constraints limit the use of these methods for studying nanostructures with more complex orientation patterns, which are abundant in nature and materials science.  Here, we introduce an imaging method that combines small-angle scattering with tensor tomog. to probe nanoscale structures in three-dimensional macroscopic samples in a non-destructive way.  We demonstrate the method by measuring the main orientation and the degree of orientation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in a human trabecula bone sample with a spatial resoln. of 25 μm.  Symmetries within the sample, such as the cylindrical symmetry commonly obsd. for mineralized collagen fibrils in bone, allow for tractable sampling requirements and numerical efficiency.  Small-angle scattering tensor tomog. is applicable to both biol. and materials science specimens, and may be useful for understanding and characterizing smart or bio-inspired materials.  Moreover, because the method is non-destructive, it is appropriate for in situ measurements and allows, for example, the role of ultrastructure in the mech. response of a biol. tissue or manufd. material to be studied.\n",

      "Small-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomog., which allows reconstruction of the local three-dimensional reciprocal-space map within a three-dimensional sample as introduced by Liebi et al. [Nature (2015), 527, 349-352], is described in more detail with regard to the math. framework and the optimization algorithm.  For the case of trabecular bone samples from vertebrae it is shown that the model of the three-dimensional reciprocal-space map using spherical harmonics can adequately describe the measured data.  The method enables the detn. of nanostructure orientation and degree of orientation as demonstrated previously in a single momentum transfer q range.  This article presents a reconstruction of the complete reciprocal-space map for the case of bone over extended ranges of q.

      "SAXS-CT is an emerging powerful imaging technique which bridges the gap between information retrieved from high-resolution local techniques and information from low-resolution, large field-of-view imaging, to determine the nanostructure characteristics of well-ordered tissues, e.g., mineralized collagen in bone.  However, in the case of soft tissues, features such as poor nanostructural organization and high susceptibility to radiation-induced damage limit the use of SAXS-CT.  Here, by combining the freeze-drying the specimen, preceded by formalin fixation, with the nanostructure survey we identified and monitored alterations on the hierarchical arrangement of triglycerides and collagen fibrils three-dimensionally in breast tumor specimens without requiring sample staining.  A high density of aligned collagen was observed precisely on the invasion front of the breast carcinoma, showing the direction of cancer spread, whereas substantial content of triglycerides was identified, where the healthy tissue was located.  Finally, the approach developed here provides a path to high-resolution nanostructural probing with a large field-of-view, which was demonstrated through the visualization of characteristic nanostructural arrangement and quantification of content and degree of organization of collagen fibrils in normal, benign and malignant human breast tissue.\n",

      "Characterizing biomolecular interactions is crucial to the understanding of biological processes.  Existing characterization methods have low spatial resolution, poor specificity, and some lack the capability for deep tissue imaging.  We describe a novel technique that relies on small-angle X-ray scattering signatures from high-contrast molecular probes that correlate with the presence of biomolecular interactions.  We describe a proof-of-concept study that uses a model system consisting of mixtures of monomer solutions of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as the non-interacting species and solutions of GNP dimers linked with an organic molecule (dimethyl suberimidate) as the interacting species.  We report estimates of the interaction fraction obtained with the proposed small-angle X-ray scattering characterization method exhibiting strong correlation with the known relative concentration of interacting and non-interacting species.\n",

      "DNA origami objects allow for accurate positioning of guest mols. in three dimensions.  Validation and understanding of design strategies for particle attachment as well as anal. of specific particle arrangements are desirable.  Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is suited to probe distances of nano-objects with subnanometer resoln. at physiol. relevant conditions including pH and salt and at varying temps.  Here, we show that the pair d. distribution function (PDDF) obtained from an indirect Fourier transform of SAXS intensities in a model-free way allows to investigate prototypical DNA origami-mediated gold nanoparticle (AuNP) assemblies.  We analyze the structure of three AuNP-dimers on a DNA origami block, an AuNP trimer constituted by those dimers, and a helical arrangement of nine AuNPs on a DNA origami cylinder.  For the dimers, we compare the model-free PDDF and explicit modeling of the SAXS intensity data by superposition of scattering intensities of the scattering objects.  The PDDF of the trimer is verified to be a superposition of its dimeric contributions, i.e., here AuNP-DNA origami assemblies were used as test boards underlining the validity of the PDDF anal. beyond pairs of AuNPs.  We obtain information about AuNP distances with an uncertainty margin of 1.2 nm.  This readout accuracy in turn can be used for high precision placement of AuNP by careful design of the AuNP attachment sites on the DNA-structure and by fine-tuning of the connector types.\n",

      "Colloidal nanoparticles may possess many functional properties, whose nature may be electronic, chem., biol., mech., etc.  It is often advantageous to incorporate them into a matrix material, e.g., a polymer soln. or melt, or an elastomer, in order to obtain a 'nanomaterial' with addnl. properties brought in by the filler particles.  One of the basic but nonetheless crucial properties is the mech. strength of such polymer nanocomposites, whose rheol. (or mech.) properties are usually better than those of the pure matrix.  The precise origin of this mech. reinforcement effect, however, remains unclear.  In this context, some recent studies of the structure and mech. properties of a special type of nanocomposites are reviewed here.  In silica-latex systems, a latex film with silica inclusions is formed from a colloidal soln. of both components.  During drying of the soln., the formation of silica domains can be controlled via the physico-chem. properties of the soln.  Well-defined silica aggregates embedded in a polymer matrix can be generated, and the mech. properties of the resulting nanocomposite have been shown to be directly correlated to the av. structure.  We believe that the fine-tuning of the structure of the filler phase opens new perspectives for systematic studies of the reinforcement effect, e.g., by modifying filler-polymer interfacial properties at fixed structure, or by generating original structures.\n",

      "The heat-induced desorption and adsorption of the proteins lysozyme, RNase A, bovine serum albumin, and fibronectin at protein layers was investigated in two different environments: pure buffer and protein soln.  Using two different environments allows us to distinguish between thermodn. and kinetic mechanisms in the adsorption process.  We obsd. a desorption in buffer and an adsorption in protein soln., depending upon protein properties, such as size, stability, and charge.  We conclude that the desorption in buffer is mainly influenced by the mobility of the proteins at the interface, while the adsorption in protein soln. is driven by conformational changes and, thereby, a gain in entropy.  These results are relevant for controlling biofilm formation at solid-liq. interfaces.\n",

      "The islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin is a pancreatic hormone and crucially involved in the pathogenesis of type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  Aggregation and amyloid formation of IAPP is considered as the primary culprit for pancreatic β-cell loss in T2DM patients.  In this study, first X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements on IAPP at lipid interfaces have been carried out, providing a mol. level characterization of the first steps of the lipid-induced fibrillation process of IAPP, which is initiated by lipid-induced nucleation, oligomerization, followed by detachment of larger IAPP aggregate structures from the lipid membrane, and terminated by the formation of mature fibrils in the bulk soln.  The adsorption process of IAPP at lipid interfaces in the absence and presence of neg. charged lipid has also been studied by complementary ATR-FTIR spectroscopic measurements.  The morphol. properties were followed by at. force microscopy (AFM).  Moreover, we show that the polyphenolic red wine compd. resveratrol is able to inhibit IAPP aggregation also in the presence of aggregation-fostering neg. charged lipid interfaces, revealing its potential as a drug candidate for T2DM.\n",

      "Drug design and targeted delivery in cells serve as a flourishing area not only for scientific inquiry, owing to numerous clin. applications, but also for understanding cell interaction with exogenous materials.  The membrane localization of heme and its analog hemin, one of the most biol. relevant planar org. mol., is very important to understand the mol. mechanism of intercalation and adsorption of this cytotoxic mol. after its dissocn. from proteins such as Hb.  Herein, the authors study the differential behavior of hemin on the soft membrane surfaces of phospholipids by synchrotron-based x-ray scattering techniques, Langmuir monolayer measurements, and mol. dynamics simulation.  A continuous hemin uptake from the subphase and intercalation into and/or adsorption on to the membrane surface have been witnessed in a strong membrane surface packing-specific manner.  Competitive interactions between hemin-membrane and hemin-hemin are proposed to be responsible for the crit. hemin concn.  Up to the limit, a continuous hemin uptake is possible and beyond that the hemin-hemin interaction dominates, effectively reducing the hemin intercalation into the membrane.  This structural model of the hemin-uptake process can be generalized to understand the localization and transport across membranes and also for the development and design of new drugs.\n",

      "The interaction of phospholipids with the peripheral membrane proteins like spectrin is important not only to understand the various physiol. functions of cells, but also to gain insight into the mechanism involved in the self-assembly of polymer-like long chain mols. at the soft surfaces and interfaces.  The lipid head-group specificity of adsorption of spectrin to supported phopsholipid bilayer model membranes has been investigated using the X-ray reflectivity (XRR) technique.  Model lipid bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) head groups have been prepd. on a soft polymer cushion and the XRR measurements have been carried out from the bilayers immersed in a water bath using high-energy synchrotron X-rays.  Our results suggest that in PC-based membranes the spectrin chains form a uniform layer on top of the bilayer with their chains lying on the membrane surface, while in PE-based membranes with relatively smaller head groups, the spectrin chains are attached only through a few possible binding sites with the rest of the part projected out of the membrane surface.  In addn., the reflectivity profiles reveal the penetration of spectrin polypeptide chains through the PE bilayer in its fluid phase.  Pressure-area isotherm measurements on Langmuir monolayers also support similar observations on the adsorption of spectrin mols. to the membranes composed of PC and PE.  The obsd. results were explained using a qual. model based on the ion-mediated protein interaction in the PC-based membrane.\n",

      "A review.  The interplay of ordering, confinement and growth in ultrathin films gives rise to various interesting phenomena not obsd. in bulk materials.  The nature of ordering and interfacial morphol. present in these films, in turn, depends on their growth mechanism.  Well-ordered metal-org. films, deposited using an enigmatic Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique, are not only ideal systems for understanding the interplay between growth and structure of ultrathin films but also for studying chem. reactions and phase transitions in confined geometries.  Studies on these LB films also enhance our understanding of the fundamental interactions of amphiphilic mols. important for biol. systems.  Advent of grazing incidence X-ray scattering techniques has enabled us to probe the interfacial structure of these multilayer films at very high resoln. and as a result has improved our knowledge about the mechanism of growth processes and about phys./chem. properties of ultrathin films.  In this review we will focus our attention on recent results obtained using these X-ray scattering techniques to understand the mechanism of growth leading to formation of remarkably well-ordered LB films after giving a brief outline of these scattering techniques.  In addn., we also review recent results on growth and structure of nanoparticles formed by suitable chem. processes within the ordered matrix of LB films.  Finally, we will discuss the work done on melting of LB films and its implications in our understanding of melting process in lower dimensions.  In all these studies, esp. those on as-deposited LB films results of at. force microscopy measurements have provided important complementary morphol. information.\n",

      "The air-water interface is an ideal platform to produce two-dimensional (2D) structures involving anything from simple org. mols. to supramol. moieties by exploiting hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions.  Here, we show, using grazing incidence X-ray scattering, the formation of a 2D ordered structure of a charge-transfer (C-T) complex, namely, dodecyl Me viologen (DMV) as acceptor and coronene tetracarboxylate potassium salt (CS) as donor, at the air-water interface.  We have obsd. a phase transition in the 2D ordered structure as the area per mol. is decreased with increasing surface pressure in a Langmuir trough.  The high-pressure ordering of the hydrocarbon chains assocd. with DMV destroys long-range C-T conjugation of DMV and CS at the air-water interface.  Our results also explain the formation of DMV-CS cylindrical reverse micelles and eventually long nanowires that get formed in the self-assembly process in the bulk medium to preserve both the C-T conjugation and the org. tail-tail organization.\n",

      "A review.  Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have been developed for imaging, drug delivery, diagnosis, and clin. therapeutic purposes because of their outstanding physicochem. characteristics.  However, the function and ultimate efficiency of nanomedicines remain unsatisfactory for clin. application, mainly because of our insufficient understanding of nanomaterial/nanomedicine-biol. (nano-bio) interactions.  The nonequilibrated, complex, and heterogeneous nature of the biol. milieu inevitably influences the dynamic bioidentity of nanoformulations at each site (i.e., the interfaces at different biol. fluids (biofluids), environments, or biol. structures) of nano-bio interactions.  The continuous interplay between a nanomedicine and the biol. mols. and structures in the biol. environments can, for example, affect cellular uptake or completely alter the designed function of the nanomedicine.  Accordingly, the weak and strong driving forces at the nano-bio interface may elicit structural reconformation, decrease bioactivity, and induce dysfunction of the nanomaterial and/or redox reactions with biol. mols., all of which may elicit unintended and unexpected biol. outcomes.  In contrast, these driving forces also can be manipulated to mitigate the toxicity of ENMs or improve the targeting abilities of ENMs.  Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nano-bio interactions is paramount for the intelligent design of safe and effective nanomedicines.In this Account, we summarize our recent progress in probing the nano-bio interaction of nanomedicines, focusing on the driving force and redox reaction at the nano-bio interface, which have been recognized as the main factors that regulate the functions and toxicities of nanomedicines.  First, we provide insight into the driving force that shapes the boundary of different nano-bio interfaces (including proteins, cell membranes, and biofluids), for instance, hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bond, mol. recognition, metal-coordinate, and stereoselective interactions that influence the different nano-bio interactions at each contact site in the biol. environment.  The physicochem. properties of both the nanoparticle and the biomol. are varied, causing structure recombination, dysfunction, and bioactivity loss of proteins; correspondingly, the surface properties, biol. functions, intracellular uptake pathways, and fate of ENMs are also influenced.  Second, with the help of these driving forces, four kinds of redox interactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant, sorbate, and the prosthetic group of oxidoreductases are utilized to regulate the intracellular redox equil. and construct synergetic nanomedicines for combating bacteria and cancers.  Three kinds of electron-transfer mechanisms are involved in designing nanomedicines, including direct electron injection, sorbate-mediated, and irradn.-induced processes.  Finally, we discuss the factors that influence the nano-bio interactions and propose corresponding strategies to manipulate the nano-bio interactions for advancing nanomedicine design.  We expect our efforts in understanding the nano-bio interaction and the future development of this field will bring nanomedicine to human use more quickly.\n",

      "A review.  Rapid growth in nanotechnol. is increasing the likelihood of engineered nanomaterials coming into contact with humans and the environment.  Nanoparticles interacting with proteins, membranes, cells, DNA and organelles establish a series of nanoparticle/biol. interfaces that depend on colloidal forces as well as dynamic biophysicochem. interactions.  These interactions lead to the formation of protein coronas, particle wrapping, intracellular uptake and biocatalytic processes that could have biocompatible or bioadverse outcomes.  For their part, the biomols. may induce phase transformations, free energy releases, restructuring and dissoln. at the nanomaterial surface.

      "A review.  Electrochem. reactions are involved in many natural phenomena, and responsible for various applications, including energy conversion and storage, material processing and protection, and chem. detection and anal.  An electrochem. reaction is accompanied by electron transfer between a chem. species and an electrode.  For this reason, it was studied by measuring current, charge or related elec. quantities.  This approach led to the development of various electrochem. methods, which have played an essential role in the understanding and applications of electrochem.  While powerful, most of the traditional methods lack spatial and temporal resolns. desired for studying heterogeneous electrochem. reactions on electrode surfaces and in nanoscale materials.  To overcome the limitations, scanning probe microscopes were invented to map local electrochem. reactions with nanometer resoln.  Examples include the Scanning Electrochem. Microscope and Scanning Electrochem. Cell Microscopes, which directly image local electrochem. reaction current using a scanning electrode or pipet.  The use of a scanning probe in these microscopes provides high spatial resoln., but at the expense of temporal resoln. and throughput.  This Account discusses an alternative approach to study electrochem. reactions.  Instead of measuring electron transfer elec., it detects the accompanying changes in the reactant and product concns. on the electrode surface optically via surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  SPR is highly surface sensitive, and it provides quant. information on the surface concns. of reactants and products vs. time and electrode potential, from which local reaction kinetics can be analyzed and quantified.  The plasmonic approach allows imaging of local electrochem. reactions with high temporal resoln. and sensitivity, making it attractive for studying electrochem. reactions in biol. systems and nanoscale materials with high throughput.  The plasmonic approach has two imaging modes: electrochem. current imaging and interfacial impedance imaging.  The former images local electrochem. current assocd. with electrochem. reactions (faradaic current), and the latter maps local interfacial impedance, including non-faradaic contributions (e.g., double layer charging).  The plasmonic imaging technique can perform voltammetry (cyclic or square wave) in an analogous manner to the traditional electrochem. methods.  It can also be integrated with bright field, dark field and fluorescence imaging capabilities in one optical setup to provide addnl. capabilities.  To date the plasmonic imaging technique found various applications, including mapping of heterogeneous surface reactions, anal. of trace substances, detection of catalytic reactions, and measurement of graphene quantum capacitance.  The plasmonic and other emerging optical imaging techniques (e.g., dark field and fluorescence microscopy), together with the scanning probe-based electrochem. imaging and single nanoparticle anal. techniques, provide new capabilities for one to study single nanoparticle electrochem. with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolns.  In this Account, the authors focus on imaging of electrochem. reactions at single nanoparticles.\n",

      "Semiconductor photocatalysis holds promising keys to address various energy and environmental challenges.  Most studies to date are based on ensemble anal., which may mask crit. photocatalytic kinetics in single nanocatalysts.  Here we report a study of imaging photocatalytic hydrogen prodn. of single CdS nanoparticles with a plasmonic microscopy in an in operando manner.  Surprisingly, we find that the photocatalytic reaction switches on and off stochastically despite the fact that the illumination is kept const.  The on and off states follow truncated and full-scale(coating process) power-law distributions in broad time scales spanning 3-4 orders of magnitude, resp., which can be described with a statistical simulation, physicochem. involving stochastic reactions rates at multiple active sites.  This phenomenon is analogous to fluorescence photoblinking, but the underlying mechanism is different.  As individual nanocatalyst represents the elementary photocatalytic platform, the discovery of the intermittent nature of the photocatalysis provides insights into the fundamental photochem. and photophysics of semiconductor nanomaterials, which is anticipated to substantially benefit broad application fields such as clean energy, pollution treatment, and chem. synthesis.\n",

      "Measuring electrochem. activities of nanomaterials is crit. for creating novel catalysts, for developing ultrasensitive sensors, and for understanding fundamental nanoelectrochem.  However, traditional electrochem. methods measure a large no. of nanoparticles, which wash out the properties of individual nanoparticles.  We report here a study of transient electrochem. oxidn. of single Ag nanoparticles during collision with an electrode and voltammetry of single nanoparticles immobilized on the electrode using a plasmonic-based electrochem. current microscopy.  This technique images both electrochem. reaction and size of the same individual nanoparticle, enabling quant. examn. of size-dependent electrochem. activities at single nanoparticle level.  The imaging capability further allows detection of the reaction kinetics of each individual nanoparticle and anal. of the av. behaviors of multiple nanoparticles.  The av. kinetics and size dependence can be accurately described by the Tafel equation, but there is a large variability between different nanoparticles, which underscores the importance of single nanoparticle anal.\n",

      "This article describes a multimodified core-shell gold@silver nanoprobe for real-time monitoring the entire autophagy process at single-cell level.  Autophagy is vital for understanding the mechanisms of human pathologies, developing novel drugs, and exploring approaches for autophagy controlling.  A major challenge for autophagy study lies in real-time monitoring.  One soln. might come from real-time detection of in situ superoxide radicals (O2•-), because it is the main regulator of autophagy.  The authors' proposed nanoprobes were etched by O2•- and gave a notable wavelength change in the plasmon resonance scattering spectra.  Both the exptl. and simulated results suggested the wavelength change rate correlated well with O2•- level.  This response enabled its application in real-time in situ quantification of O2•- during autophagy course.  More importantly, with the introduction of relay probe operation, two types of O2•--regulating autophagy processes were successfully traced from the beginning to the end, and the possible mechanism is also proposed.\n",

      "A review.  This Perspective provides a contemporary understanding of the shape evolution of colloidal metal nanocrystals under thermodynamically and kinetically controlled conditions.  It was extremely challenging to study this subject in the setting of 1-pot synthesis because both the type and no. of seeds involved would be changed whenever the exptl. conditions are altered, making it essentially impossible to draw conclusions when comparing the outcomes of 2 syntheses conducted under different conditions.  Because of the uncertainty about seeds, most of the mechanistic insights reported in literature for 1-pot syntheses of metal nanocrystals with different shapes are either incomplete or ambiguous, and some of them might be misleading or even wrong.  Recently, using well-defined seeds for such syntheses, it became possible to sep. growth from nucleation and therefore study the explicit role(s) played by a specific thermodn. or kinetic parameter in directing the evolution of colloidal metal nanocrystals into a specific shape.  Starting from single-crystal seeds enclosed by a mix of {100}, {111}, and {110} facets, for example, one can obtain colloidal nanocrystals with diversified shapes by adjusting various thermodn. or kinetic parameters.  The mechanistic insights learned from these studies can also be extended to account for the products of conventional 1-pot syntheses that involve self-nucleation only.  The knowledge can be further applied to many other types of seeds with twin defects or stacking faults, making it an exciting time to design and synthesize colloidal metal nanocrystals with the shapes sought for a variety of fundamental studies and technol. important applications.\n",

Live COS-7 cells were maintained in a microfluidic chamber and imaged using scanning TEM.  A quant. image anal. showed that Au-NPs bound to the membranes of vesicles, possibly lysosomes, and occupied 67% of the available surface area.

      "Supramol. chem. uses coordination bonds to assemble mol. building blocks into a variety of sophisticated constructs.  However, traditional coordination assemblies are based on org. compds. that have limited ability to transport charge.  Herein, the authors describe coordination assembly of anisotropic FeS2 pyrite nanoparticles (NPs) that can facilitate charge transport.  Zn2+ ions form supramol. complexes with carboxylate end-groups on NP surface, leading to multiparticle sheets with liq.-crystal-like organization.  Cond. and Hall carrier mobility of the p-type layered semiconductor films with Zn2+ coordination bridging exceed those known for coordination compds., some by several orders of magnitude.  The nanoscale porosity of the assembled sheets combined with fast hole transport leads to high electrocatalytic activity of the NP films.  The coordination assembly of NPs embraces the versatility of several types of building blocks and opens a new design space for self-organized materials combining nanoscale and supramol. structural motifs.\n",

      "The chem. and catalytic activity of nanoparticles has strongly contributed to the current tremendous interest in engineered nanomaterials and often serves as a guiding principle for the design of functional materials.  Since it has most recently become evident that such active materials can enter into cells or organisms, the present study investigates the level of intracellular oxidns. after exposure to iron-, cobalt-, manganese-, and titania-contg. silica nanoparticles and the corresponding pure oxides in vitro.  The resulting oxidative stress was quant. measured as the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  The use of thoroughly characterized nanoparticles of the same morphol., comparable size, shape, and degree of agglomeration allowed sepn. of phys. (rate of particle uptake, agglomeration, sedimentation) and chem. effects (oxidns.).  Three sets of control expts. elucidated the role of nanoparticles as carriers for heavy metal uptake and excluded a potential interference of the biol. assay with the nanomaterial.  The present results indicate that the particles could efficiently enter the cells by a Trojan-horse type mechanism which provoked an up to eight times higher oxidative stress in the case of cobalt or manganese if compared to ref. cultures exposed to aq. solns. of the same metals.  A systematic investigation on iron-contg. nanoparticles as used in industrial fine chem. synthesis demonstrated that the presence of catalytic activity could strongly alter the damaging action of a nanomaterial.  This indicates that a proactive development of nanomaterials and their risk assessment should consider chem. and catalytic properties of nanomaterials beyond a mere focus on phys. properties such as size, shape, and degree of agglomeration.\n",

      "The structural dynamics of charge-transfer states of N-ligated Cu complexes was extensively studied in recent years following the development of pump-probe x-ray techniques.  The authors extend this approach towards Cu complexes with S coordination and study the influence of charge transfer states on the structure of a dicopper(I) complex with coordination by bridging disulfide ligands and addnl. tetramethylguanidine units [CuI2(NSSN)2]2+.  To directly observe and refine the photoinduced structural changes in the solvated complex the authors applied picosecond pump-probe x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS).  Addnl., the ultrafast evolution of the electronic excited states was monitored by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in the UV-visible probe range.  DFT calcns. were used to predict mol. geometries and electronic structures of the ground and metal-to-ligand charge transfer states with singlet and triplet spin multiplicities, i.e. S0, 1MLCT and 3MLCT, resp.  Combining these techniques the authors elucidate the electronic and structural dynamics of the solvated complex upon photoexcitation to the MLCT states.  In particular, femtosecond optical transient spectroscopy reveals three distinct timescales of 650 fs, 10 ps and >100 ps, which were assigned as internal conversion to the ground state (Sn → S0), intersystem crossing 1MLCT → 3MLCT, and subsequent relaxation of the triplet to the ground state, resp.  Exptl. data collected using both x-ray techniques are in agreement with the DFT-predicted structure for the triplet state, where coordination bond lengths change and one of the S-S bridges is cleaved, causing the movement of two halves of the mol. relative to each other.  Extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy resolves changes in Cu-ligand bond lengths with precision ∼0.01 Å, whereas WAXS is sensitive to changes in the global shape related to relative movement of parts of the mol.  The results presented herein widen the knowledge on the electronic and structural dynamics of photoexcited Cu-S complexes and demonstrate the potential of combining the pump-probe x-ray absorption and scattering for studies on photoinduced structural dynamics in Cu-based coordination complexes.\n",

      "Investigation of the genotoxic potential of nanomaterials is essential to evaluate if they pose a cancer risk for exposed workers and consumers.  The Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-K1 is recommended by the OECD for use in the micronucleus assay and is commonly used for genotoxicity testing.  However, studies investigating if this cell line is suitable for the genotoxic evaluation of nanomaterials, including induction of DNA adduct and micronuclei formation, are rare and for silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) missing.  Therefore, the authors here systematically investigated DNA and chromosomal damage induced by BSA coated Ag NPs (15.9 nm) in CHO-K1 cells in relation to cellular uptake and intracellular localization, their effects on mitochondrial activity and prodn. of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell cycle, apoptosis and necrosis.  Ag NPs are taken up by CHO-K1 cells and are presumably translocated into endosomes/lysosomes.  The authors' cytotoxicity studies demonstrated a concn.-dependent decrease of mitochondrial activity and increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CHO-K1 cells following exposure to Ag NPs and Ag+ (0-20 μg/mL) for 24 h.  Annexin V/propidium iodide assay showed that Ag NPs and Ag+ induced apoptosis and necrosis, which is in agreement with an increased fraction of cells in subG1 phase of the cell cycle.  Genotoxicity studies showed that Ag NPs but also silver ions (Ag+) induced bulky-DNA adducts, 8-oxodG and micronuclei formation in a concn.-dependent manner, however, there were quant. and qual. differences between the particulate and ionic form of silver.  Taken together, the authors' multi-platform genotoxicity and cytotoxicity anal. demonstrates that CHO-K1 cells are suitable for the investigation of genotoxicity of nanoparticles like Ag NPs.\n",

      "Nanomaterials (NM) exhibit novel physicochem. properties that det. their interaction with biol. substrates and processes.  Three metal oxide nanoparticles that are currently being produced in high tonnage, TiO2, ZnO, and CeO2, were synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis process and compared in a mechanistic study to elucidate the physicochem. characteristics that det. cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and toxic effects based on a test paradigm that was originally developed for oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 and BEAS-2B cell lines.  ZnO induced toxicity in both cells, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidant injury, excitation of inflammation, and cell death.  Using ICP-MS and fluorescent-labeled ZnO, it is found that ZnO dissoln. could happen in culture medium and endosomes.  Nondissolved ZnO nanoparticles enter caveolae in BEAS-2B but enter lysosomes in RAW 264.7 cells in which smaller particle remnants dissolve.  In contrast, fluorescent-labeled CeO2 nanoparticles were taken up intact into caveolin-1 and LAMP-1 pos. endosomal compartments, resp., in BEAS-2B and RAW 264.7 cells, without inflammation or cytotoxicity.  Instead, CeO2 suppressed ROS prodn. and induced cellular resistance to an exogenous source of oxidative stress.  Fluorescent-labeled TiO2 was processed by the same uptake pathways as CeO2 but did not elicit any adverse or protective effects.  These results demonstrate that metal oxide nanoparticles induce a range of biol. responses that vary from cytotoxic to cytoprotective and can only be properly understood by using a tiered test strategy such as the authors developed for oxidative stress and adapted to study other aspects of nanoparticle toxicity.\n",

      "The liver and the mononuclear phagocyte system are a frequent target for engineered nanomaterials, either as a result of particle uptake and spread from primary exposure sites or systemic administration of therapeutic and imaging nanoparticles.  In this study, the authors performed a comparative anal. of the toxicol. impact of 29 metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), some commonly used in consumer products, in transformed or primary Kupffer cells (KCs) and hepatocytes.  The authors not only obsd. differences between KCs and hepatocytes, but also differences in the toxicol. profiles of transition-metal oxides (TMOs, e.g., Co3O4) vs. rare-earth oxide (REO) NPs (e.g., Gd2O3).  While pro-oxidative TMOs induced the activation of caspases 3 and 7, resulting in apoptotic cell death in both cell types, REOs induced lysosomal damage, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase 1 activation, and pyroptosis in KCs.  Pyroptosis was accompanied by cell swelling, membrane blebbing, IL-1β release, and increased membrane permeability, which could be reversed by knockdown of the pore forming protein, gasdermin D.  Though similar features were not seen in hepatocytes, the investigation of the cytotoxic effects of REO NPs could also be seen to affect macrophage cell lines such as J774A.1 and RAW 264.7 cells as well as bone marrow-derived macrophages.  These phagocytic cell types also demonstrated features of pyroptosis and increased IL-1β prodn.  Collectively, these findings demonstrate important mechanistic considerations that can be used for safety evaluation of metal oxides, including com. products that are developed from these materials.\n",

      "Abstr.: The safe implementation of nanotechnol. requires nanomaterial hazard assessment in accordance with the material physicochem. properties that trigger the injury response at the nano/bio interface.  Since CuO nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used industrially and their dissoln. properties play a major role in hazard potential, the authors hypothesized that tighter bonding of Cu to Fe by particle doping could constitute a safer-by-design approach through decreased dissoln.  Accordingly, the authors designed a combinatorial library in which CuO was doped with 1-10% Fe in a flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) reactor.  The morphol. and structural properties were detd. by x-ray diffraction, BET, Raman spectroscopy, HRTEM, EFTEM and EELS, which demonstrated a significant redn. in the apical Cu-O bond length while simultaneously increasing the planar bond length (Jahn-Teller distortion).  Hazard screening was performed in tissue culture cell lines and zebrafish embryos to discern the change in the hazardous effects of doped vs. non-doped particles.  This demonstrated that with increased levels of doping, there was a progressive decrease in cytotoxicity in BEAS-2B and THP-1 cells, as well as an incremental decrease in the rate of hatching interference in zebrafish embryos.  The dissoln. profiles were detd. and the surface reactions taking place in Holtfreter's soln. were validated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements to demonstrate the Cu+/Cu2+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ redox species playing a major role in the dissoln. process of pure and Fe doped CuO.  Altogether, a safe-by-design strategy was implemented for the toxic CuO particles via Fe doping and has been demonstrated for their safe use in the environment.  Keywords: flame spray pyrolysis, CuO nanoparticles, Fe doping, Jahn-Teller distortion, cyclic voltammetry, safe-by-design.\n",

      "A key challenge for the use of inorg. nanomedicines in clin. applications is their long-term accumulation in internal organs, which raises the common concern of the risk of adverse effects and inflammatory responses.  It is thus necessary to rationally design inorg. nanomaterials with proper accumulation and clearance mechanism in vivo.  Herein, we prepd. ultrasmall Cu3BiS3 nanodots (NDs) as a single-phased ternary bimetal sulfide for photothermal cancer therapy guided by multispectral optoacoustic tomog. (MSOT) and X-ray computed tomog. (CT) due to bismuth's excellent X-ray attenuation coeff.  We then monitored and investigated their absorption, distribution, metab., and excretion.  We also used CT imaging to demonstrate that Cu3BiS3 NDs can be quickly removed through renal clearance, which may be related to their small size, rapid chem. transformation, and degrdn. in an acidic lysosomal environment as characterized by synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy.  These results reveal that Cu3BiS3 NDs act as a simple but powerful \"theranostic\" nanoplatform for MSOT/CT imaging-guided tumor ablation with excellent metab. and rapid clearance that will improve safety for clin. applications in the future.\n",

      "A review.  Absorption, distribution, metab. and excretion (ADME) of nanomaterials (NMs) or nanomedicines (NMs), are fundamental biol. processes that dominate their nanomedical functions or nanotoxicities.  Mostly, NMs exist in biol. systems as a form of nanoparticles (NPs).  However, to det. the compn., spatial distribution, and states of existence of NMs/NPs in vivo, upon entry into the body, as well as to monitor the dynamic changes of these information over time remain a challenge for the current anal. methodol. due to their limited efficiently in characterizing interactions between these complex(nano)-complex(bio) systems.  NMs/NPs are more complicated compared with the classic chem. mols., ions or elements, while biol. systems pose even greater difficulties being a complicated network of chem./biol. compn., multihierarchical structures, the highly dynamic nature, nonequil. states and nonlinear chem. processes, etc.  Thus, although some existing methods/protocols have promoted the understanding of how NMs/NPs interact with biol. systems, almost none of these are fully adequate for quant. analyses.  Examples of conventional methods used for nano-bio anal. include, methods for element quantification which are partially applicable for NMs/NPs, such as at. spectrometry, isotopic labeling and nuclear anal. methods, which are useful for elemental identification in detn. of accumulation and distributions, and imaging-based methods have facilitated the quantification of NMs/NPs during their in vivo transportation, translocation and transformation processes.  In the early stage of nanosafety research, qual. study of NMs/NPs' behaviors in vivo was widely employed, which, however, have resulted in much inconsistency or even contradiction among reports on the same NMs/NPs' safety profile from different labs.  Recently, it was recognized that quant. anal. method are necessary for the accurate characterization of the complicated behaviors of NMs/NPs in vivo.  For example, in order to understand the in vivo biol. effects of a given nanomaterial, one needs to first monitor the dynamic changes of its components in blood circulation as well as in different organs or tissues to det. key bio-parameters such as the half-lives, and the compn. of metabolites of the nanomaterial interested, etc.  Such understanding requires quant. methodol. to construct a reliably whole spectrum of NMs/NPs' fate in vivo, which would be essential not only in nanosafety assessment of NMs/NPs, but also in the development of their biomedical applications in fields such as cancer nanotechnol.\n",

      "Mitochondrial redox homeostasis, the balance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidants such as glutathione, plays crit. roles in many biol. processes, including biosynthesis and apoptosis, and thus is a potential target for cancer treatment.  Here, we report a mitochondrial oxidative stress amplifier, MitoCAT-g, which consists of carbon-dot-supported atomically dispersed gold (CAT-g) with further surface modifications of triphenylphosphine and cinnamaldehyde.  We find that the MitoCAT-g particles specifically target mitochondria and deplete mitochondrial glutathione with at. economy, thus amplifying the reactive oxygen species damage caused by cinnamaldehyde and finally leading to apoptosis in cancer cells.  We show that imaging-guided interventional injection of these particles potently inhibits tumor growth in s.c. and orthotopic patient-derived xenograft hepatocellular carcinoma models without adverse effects.  Our study demonstrates that MitoCAT-g amplifies the oxidative stress in mitochondria and suppresses tumor growth in vivo, representing a promising agent for anticancer applications.\n",

      "A review.  In this perspective, the HERFD-XANES (high energy resoln. fluorescence detected x-ray absorption near edge structure) and Kβ2,5- or V2C-XES (valence-to-core X-ray emission spectroscopy) methods are discussed as new and powerful tools for chem. research with hard X-rays.  This includes a brief survey of the underlying phys. processes and the introduction of exptl. issues.  The potential of both methods to overcome limitations of conventional XAS (x-ray absorption spectroscopy) and to push the limits for obtaining new information about the electronic and geometric structures of metal centers, in the solid state structure or heterogeneous catalysts, but also in metal complexes and homogeneous catalysts, is discussed by presenting a survey of representative refs. and recent own studies, rounded off by a conclusion and outlook.\n",

      "A review.  This Progress Report discusses the chem. sensitivity of Kβ valence to core X-ray emission spectroscopy (vtc-XES) and its applications for investigating 3d-transition-metal based materials.  Vtc-XES can be used for ligand identification and for the characterization of the valence electronic levels.  The technique provides information that is similar to valence band photoemission spectroscopy but the sample environment can be chosen freely and thus allows measurements in presence of gases and liqs. and it can be applied for measurements under in situ/operando or extreme conditions.  The theor. basis of the technique is presented using a one-electron approach and the vtc-XES spectral features are interpreted using ground state d. functional theory calcns.  Some recent results obtained by vtc-XES in various scientific fields are discussed to demonstrate the potential and future applications of this technique.  Resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy is briefly introduced with some applications for the study of 3d and 5d-transition-metal based systems.\n",

Compared with La(OH)3 or previously known hexagonal La2O2CO3 structures, La in the monoclinic unit cell has a much lower no. of neighboring oxygen atoms, which is manifested in the white line broadening in XANES spectra.  Such a superior sensitivity to subtle changes is given by HERFD method, which is essential for in situ studying of the interaction with CO2.

The distribution of unoccupied La d-states and occupied O p- and La d-states changes during CO2 chemoresistive sensing of La2O2CO3.  The correlation between these spectroscopic findings with elec. resistance measurements leads to a more comprehensive understanding of the selective adsorption at La site and may enable the design of new materials for CO2 electrochem. applications.\n",

      "Nitrogenase is a complex enzyme that catalyzes the redn. of N2 to NH3.  Despite insight from structural and biochem. studies, its structure and mechanism await full characterization.  An Fe-Mo cofactor (FeMoco) is thought to be the site of N2 redn., but the identity of a central atom in this cofactor remains unknown.  Here, Fe Kβ x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) of intact nitrogenase MoFe protein, isolated FeMoco, and the FeMoco-deficient ΔnifB protein indicated that among the candidate atoms (O, N, and C), it was C that best fit the XES data.  The exptl. XES was supported by computational efforts, which showed that oxidn. and spin states did not affect the assignment of the central atom to C4-.  Identification of the central atom will drive further studies on its role in catalysis.\n",

      "X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a powerful probe of mol. structure, but it has previously been too slow to track the earliest dynamics after photoexcitation.  We investigated the ultrafast formation of the lowest quintet state of aq. iron(II) tris(bipyridine) upon excitation of the singlet metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (1MLCT) state by femtosecond optical pump/x-ray probe techniques based on x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES).  By recording the intensity of a characteristic XANES feature as a function of laser pump/x-ray probe time delay, we find that the quintet state is populated in about 150 fs.  The quintet state is further evidenced by its full XANES spectrum recorded at a 300-fs time delay.  These results resolve a long-standing issue about the population mechanism of quintet states in iron(II)-based complexes, which we identify as a simple 1MLCT→3MLCT→5T cascade from the initially excited state.  The time scale of the 3MLCT→5T relaxation corresponds to the period of the iron-nitrogen stretch vibration.\n",

The authors measured and calcd. the full 1s2p RIXS planes for opposite helicities of the incoming circularly polarized x-rays.

      "In-situ carbon-thermal redn. of cobalt oxide nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes was studied by cobalt 2p3d resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS).  The in-situ 2p X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and RIXS measurements were performed at 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C, where four consistent excitations energies were used for RIXS acquisitions.  After 700 °C redn., the XAS spectrum shows a cobalt metal-like shape, while the RIXS spectra reveal the minority cobalt monoxide phase.  The holistic fit on both XAS and RIXS data reveals the resp. contributions from metal and monoxide.  We show that the relative precision to det. the monoxide content changes from ∼5.6% in XAS results to better than 0.8% in the RIXS anal., suggesting that RIXS is a useful tool to track the oxidn. state of nanoparticles under in-situ conditions.  We detd. a relative radiative ratio (P) factor of approx. 5, where this factor gives the ratio between the relative strengths of the radiative decay channels compared to the non-radiative channels in CoO and Co metal.\n",

      "Nanostructures of transition metal oxides, such as zinc oxide, have attracted considerable interest for solar-energy conversion and photocatalysis.  Both applications are sensitive to the transport and trapping of photoexcited charge carriers.  The probing of electron trapping has recently become possible using time-resolved element-sensitive methods, such as X-ray spectroscopy.  However, valence-band-trapped holes have so far escaped observation.  Herein we use X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with a dispersive X-ray emission spectrometer to probe the charge carrier relaxation and trapping processes in zinc oxide nanoparticles after above band-gap photoexcitation.  Our results, supported by simulations, demonstrate that within 80 ps, photoexcited holes are trapped at singly charged oxygen vacancies, which causes an outward displacement by ~15% of the four surrounding zinc atoms away from the doubly charged vacancy.  This identification of the hole traps provides insight for future developments of transition metal oxide-based nanodevices.\n",

      "Zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the most versatile semiconductor materials with multifarious potential applications.  Easily accessible alkylzinc alkoxides have been widely exploited as single-source precursors of ZnO-based nanomaterials but their multi-step decompn. pathways have not been understood in detail.  Herein, the formation mechanism of ZnO nanocrystals via solid-state thermal decompn. of a model pre-organised alkylzinc alkoxide precursor, i.e. [tBuZn(μ3-OtBu)]4, is elucidated using in situ valence-to-core X-ray emission (v2c-XES) and high energy resoln. off-resonant spectroscopy (HEROS) in conjunction with theor. calcns.  Combination of in situ spectroscopic measurements and theor. simulations indicates that the precursor structural evolution is initiated by the homolytic cleavage of the R-Zn bond, which leads to the formation of a transient radical ([Zn(μ3-OR)][RZn(μ3-OR)]3) species, which is responsible for the initial decompn. process.  The ensuing multistep transformations involve the formation of intermediate radical zinc oxo-alkoxide clusters with gapless electronic states.  Hitherto, the formation of clusters of this type has not been considered either as intermediate structures en route to a semiconductor ZnO phase or as potential species accounting for various defect states of ZnO NCs, particularly the singly charged oxygen vacancy, Vo+.\n",

      "Stochastic processes are highly relevant in research fields as different as neuroscience, economy, ecology, chemistry, and fundamental physics.  However, due to their intrinsic unpredictability, stochastic mechanisms are very challenging for any kind of investigations and practical applications.  Here we report the deliberate use of stochastic X-ray pulses in two-dimensional spectroscopy to the simultaneous mapping of unoccupied and occupied electronic states of atoms in a regime where the opacity and transparency properties of matter are subject to the incident intensity and photon energy.  A readily transferable matrix formalism is presented to extract the electronic states from a dataset measured with the monitored input from a stochastic excitation source.  The presented formalism enables investigations of the response of the electronic structure to irradiation with intense X-ray pulses while the time structure of the incident pulses is preserved.\n",

      "The increasing use of nanoparticles (NP) in com. products requires elaborated techniques to detect NP in the tissue of exposed organisms.  However, due to the low amt. of material, the detection and exact localization of NP within tissue sections is demanding.  In this respect, Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and Ion Beam Microscopy (IBM) are promising techniques, because they both offer sub-micron lateral resolns. along with high sensitivities.  Here, we compare the performance of the non-material-consumptive IBM and material-consumptive ToF-SIMS for the detection of ZrO2 NP (primary size 9-10 nm) in rat lung tissue.  Unfixed or methanol-fixed air-dried cryo-sections were subjected to IBM using proton beam scanning or to three-dimensional ToF-SIMS (3D ToF-SIMS) using either oxygen or argon gas cluster ion beams for complete sample sputtering.  Some sample sites were analyzed first by IBM and subsequently by 3D ToF-SIMS, to compare results from exactly the same site.  Both techniques revealed that ZrO2 NP particles occurred mostly agglomerated in phagocytic cells with only small quantities being assocd. to the lung epithelium, with Zr, S, and P colocalized within the same biol. structures.  However, while IBM provided quant. information on element distribution, 3D ToF-SIMS delivered a higher lateral resoln. and a lower limit of detection under these conditions.  We, therefore, conclude that 3D ToF-SIMS, although not yet a quant. technique, is a highly valuable tool for the detection of NP in biol. tissue.\n",

      "The investigation of the toxicol. profile and biomedical potential of nanoparticles (NPs) requires a deep understanding of their intracellular fate.  Various techniques are usually employed to characterize NPs upon cellular internalization, including high-resoln. optical and electron microscopies.  Here, the authors show a versatile method, named sputtering-enabled intracellular XPS, proving that it is able to provide valuable information about the behavior of metallic NPs in culture media as well as within cells, directly measuring their internalization, stability/degrdn., and oxidn. state, without any preparative steps.  The technique can also provide nanoscale vertical resoln. along with semiquant. information about the cellular internalization of the metallic species.  The proposed approach is easy-to-use and can become a std. technique in nanotoxicol./nanomedicine and in the rational design of metallic NPs.  Two model cases were investigated: silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) with the same size and coating.  The authors obsd. that, after 48 h incubation, intracellular AgNPs were almost completely dissolved, forming nanoclusters as well as AgO, AgS, and AgCl complexes.  On the other hand, PtNPs were resistant to the harsh endolysosomal environment, and only some surface oxidn. was detected after 48 h.\n",

      "X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy was used to probe the diffusive dynamics of colloidal particles in a shear flow.  Combining x-ray techniques with microfluidics is an exptl. strategy that reduces the risk of x-ray-induced beam damage and also allows time-resolved studies of processes taking place in flow cells.  The exptl. results and theor. predictions presented here show that in the low shear limit for a 'transverse flow' scattering geometry (scattering wavevector q perpendicular to the direction of flow) the measured relaxation times are independent of the flow rate and detd. only by the diffusive motion of the particles.  This is not generally valid and, in particular, for a 'longitudinal flow' (q ‖ flow) scattering geometry the relaxation times are strongly affected by the flow-induced motion of the particles.  The Brownian diffusion of colloidal particles can be measured in a flowing sample and that, up to flux limitations, the exptl. conditions under which this is possible are easier to achieve at higher values of q.\n",

      "X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy was used to measure the diffusive dynamics of colloidal particles in a shear flow.  The results presented here show how the intensity autocorrelation functions measure both the diffusive dynamics of the particles and their flow-induced, convective motion.  However, in the limit of low flow/shear rates, it is possible to obtain the diffusive component of the dynamics, which makes the method suitable for the study of the dynamical properties of a large class of complex soft-matter and biol. fluids.  An important benefit of this exptl. strategy over more traditional X-ray methods is the minimization of X-ray-induced beam damage.  While the method can be applied also for photon correlation spectroscopy in the visible domain, the anal. shows that the exptl. conditions under which it is possible to measure the diffusive dynamics are easier to achieve at higher q values (with X-rays).\n",

We det. the thresholds above which the x-ray pulses disturb the at. arrangements.

      "X-ray radiation damage provides a serious bottleneck for investigating microsecond to second dynamics on nanometer length scales employing x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy.  This limitation hinders the investigation of real time dynamics in most soft matter and biol. materials which can tolerate only x-ray doses of kGy and below.  Here, we show that this bottleneck can be overcome by low dose x-ray speckle visibility spectroscopy.  Employing x-ray doses of 22-438 kGy and analyzing the sparse speckle pattern of count rates as low as 6.7×10-3 per pixel, we follow the slow nanoscale dynamics of an ionic liq. (IL) at the glass transition.  At the prepeak of nanoscale order in the IL, we observe complex dynamics upon approaching the glass transition temp. TG with a freezing in of the alpha relaxation and a multitude of millisecond local relaxations existing well below TG.  We identify this fast relaxation as being responsible for the increasing development of nanoscale order obsd. in ILs at temps. below TG.\n",

      "We explore the origins of slow dynamics, aging and glassy rheol. in soft and living matter.  Non-diffusive slow dynamics and aging in materials characterised by crowding of the constituents can be explained in terms of structural rearrangement or remodelling events that occur within the jammed state.  In this context, we introduce the jamming phase diagram proposed by Liu and Nagel to understand the ergodic-nonergodic transition in these systems, and discuss recent theor. attempts to explain the unusual, faster-than-exponential dynamical structure factors obsd. in jammed soft materials.  We next focus on the anomalous rheol. (flow and deformation behavior) ubiquitous in soft matter characterised by metastability and structural disorder, and refer to the Soft Glassy Rheol. (SGR) model that quantifies the mech. response of these systems and predicts aging under suitable conditions.  As part of a survey of exptl. work related to these issues, we present x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) results of the aging of laponite clay suspensions following rejuvenation.  We conclude by exploring the scientific literature for recent theor. advances in the understanding of these models and for exptl. investigations aimed at testing their predictions.\n",

      "We investigate the out-of-equil. dynamics of a colloidal gel obtained by quenching a suspension of soft polymer-coated gold nanoparticles close to and below its gelation point using X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy.  A faster relaxation process emergent from the localized motions of the nanoparticles reveals a dynamically-arrested network at the nanoscale as a key signature of the gelation process.  We find that the slower network dynamics is hyperdiffusive with a compressed exponential form, consistent with stress-driven relaxation processes.  Specifically, we use direction-dependent correlation functions to characterize the anisotropy in dynamics.  We show that the anisotropy is greater for the gel close to its gelation point than at lower temps., and the anisotropy decreases as the gel ages.  We quantify the anisotropic dynamical heterogeneities emergent in such a stress-driven dynamical system using higher order intensity correlations, and demonstrate that the aging phenomenon contributes significantly to the properties evaluated by the fluctuations in the intensity correlations.  Our results provide important insights into the structural origin of the emergent anisotropic and cooperative heterogeneous dynamics, and we discuss analogies with previous work on other soft disordered systems.\n",

      "This study explores the possibility of measuring the dynamics of proteins in solution using X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) at nearly diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs).  We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of XPCS experiments from a concentrated lysozyme solution at the length scale of the hydrodynamic radius of the protein molecule.  We take into account limitations given by the critical X-ray dose and find expressions for the SNR as a function of beam size, sample-to-detector distance and photon energy.  Specifically, we show that the combined increase in coherent flux and coherence lengths at the DLSR PETRA IV yields an increase in SNR of more than one order of magnitude.  The resulting SNR values indicate that XPCS experiments of biological macromolecules on nanometre length scales will become feasible with the advent of a new generation of synchrotron sources.  Our findings provide valuable input for the design and construction of future XPCS beamlines at DLSRs.\n",

      "The application of X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) at free-electron laser (FEL) facilities enables, for the first time, the study of dynamics on a (sub-)nanometer scale in an unreached time range between femtoseconds and seconds.  For soft-matter materials, radiation damage is a major limitation when going beyond single-shot applications.  Here, an XPCS study is presented at a hard X-ray FEL on radiation-sensitive polymeric poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanoparticles.  The dynamics of aq. suspensions of densely packed silica-PNIPAM core-shell particles and a PNIPAM nanogel below the radiation-damage threshold are detd.  The XPCS data indicate non-diffusive behavior, suggesting ballistic and stress-dominated heterogeneous particle motions.  These results demonstrate the feasibility of XPCS expts. on radiation-sensitive soft-matter materials at FEL sources and pave the way for future applications at MHz repetition rates as well as ultrafast modes using split-pulse devices.\n",

      "A review.  Fluidic shear stress generated by fluid flow in human body contributes to the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and cells and may affect cellular distribution and delivery of NPs.  Furthermore, different NPs properties may differently influence the cellular delivery and targeting of NPs under the in vivo dynamic environments.  Thus, we reviewed and discussed how fluidic shear stress affects to drug delivery and cellular distribution of diverse NPs under the biomimetic microfluidic shear stress.  Among different physicochem. properties of NPs, size, shape, material type and surface functionality, and surface charge of NPs are crit. factors to cellular uptake in presence of fluidic shear stress in dynamic cellular environment.  From previous studies, it suggested that fluidic shear stress stimulated specific endocytosis and prompted cell signaling pathway.  The cellular interactions between NPs and cells in drug delivery should be carefully investigated in presence of shear stress which is one of crit. factors to show the difference of in vitro and in vivo drug distribution and therapy.  The shear-activated drug delivery using NPs were also the scope of this review.\n",

      "Atherosclerosis results in the narrowing of arterial blood vessels and this causes significant changes in the endogenous shear stress between healthy and constricted arteries.  Nanocontainers that can release drugs locally with such rheol. changes can be very useful.  Here, we show that vesicles made from an artificial 1,3-diaminophospholipid are stable under static conditions but release their contents at elevated shear stress.  These vesicles have a lenticular morphol., which potentially leads to instabilities along their equator.  Using a model cardiovascular system based on polymer tubes and an external pump to represent shear stress in healthy and constricted vessels of the heart, we show that drugs preferentially release from the vesicles in constricted vessels that have high shear stress.\n",

      "A review.  Stenosed segments of arteries significantly alter the blood flow known from healthy vessels.  In particular, the wall shear stress at critically stenosed arteries is at least an order of magnitude higher than in healthy situations.  This alteration represents a change in phys. force and might be used as a trigger signal for drug delivery.  Mechano-sensitive drug delivery systems that preferentially release their payload under increased shear stress are discussed.  Therefore, besides biol. or chem. markers, phys. triggers are a further principle approach for targeted drug delivery.  The authors hypothesize that such a phys. trigger is much more powerful to release drugs for vasodilation, plaque stabilization, or clot lysis at stenosed arteries than any known biol. or chem. ones.\n",

      "In this review we focus on shear targeted drug delivery as a novel strategy to selectively deliver drugs to sites of vascular obstruction.  We review the physics of stenotic (abnormally narrowed) blood vessels, while focusing mainly on the hemodynamics and transport phenomena at these sites.  We then discuss how the local abnormal levels of shear stress, which can mechanically activate platelets, can be leveraged for localized drug delivery.  We describe the development of Shear Activated Nano-particle Aggregates (SA-NPAs) that are designed to release and localize their nanoparticle drug carriers at sites of vascular stenosis.  We present results in a variety of in vivo models, demonstrating the superiority of SA-NPAs carrying a thrombolytic drug compared to conventional treatment with the free drug.  We also describe, shear-stress sensitive lenticular liposomes, which also show selective release under stenotic flow conditions.  We then discuss limitations of both technologies, challenges in this new field and potential future applications.  Altogether, we believe that mechano-sensitive therapeutics may offer a potential new approach for treatment of cardiovascular diseases.\n",

      "Obstruction of crit. blood vessels due to thrombosis or embolism is a leading cause of death worldwide.  Here, we describe a biomimetic strategy that uses high shear stress caused by vascular narrowing as a targeting mechanism-in the same way platelets do-to deliver drugs to obstructed blood vessels.  Microscale aggregates of nanoparticles were fabricated to break up into nanoscale components when exposed to abnormally high fluid shear stress.  When coated with tissue plasminogen activator and administered i.v. in mice, these shear-activated nanotherapeutics induce rapid clot dissoln. in a mesenteric injury model, restore normal flow dynamics, and increase survival in an otherwise fatal mouse pulmonary embolism model.  This biophys. strategy for drug targeting, which lowers required doses and minimizes side effects while maximizing drug efficacy, offers a potential new approach for treatment of life-threatening diseases that result from acute vascular occlusion.\n",

      "Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) studies of monolayers of biomols. at an air-water interface give quant. information of in-plane packing, coherence length of cryst. domains, etc.  Rheo-GIXD measurements can reveal quant. changes in the nanocryst. domains of a monolayer under shear.  Here, we report GIXD studies of monolayers of alamethicin peptide, DPPC lipid, and their mixts. at an air-water interface under steady shear stress.  The alamethicin monolayer and the mixed monolayer show a flow jamming transition.  On the other hand, the pure 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) monolayer under const. stress flows steadily with a notable enhancement of the area/mol. and coherence lengths, suggesting the fusion of nanocrystallites during flow.  The DPPC-alamethicin mixed monolayer shows no significant change in the area/DPPC mol., but the coherence lengths of the individual phases (DPPC and alamethicin) increase, suggesting that the crystallites of individual phases grow bigger by merging of domains.  More phase sepn. occurs in the system during flow.  Our results show that rheo-GIXD has the potential to explore in situ mol. structural changes under rheol. conditions for a diverse range of confined biomols. at interfaces.\n",

X-ray fluorescence maps show uniform Zn and Co distributions along the wire within the length scale of the beam size.  The x-ray fluorescence data allow the estn. of the Co content within the nanowire.  Polarization dependent x-ray absorption near edge structure shows no structural disorder induced neither in the radial nor axial directions of the implanted nanowires after subsequent annealing.  Co2+ ions occupy Zn sites into the wurtzite ZnO lattice.

      "The elemental distribution and local structure of single InxGa1-xN nanowires (NWs) grown by MBE on Si (111) substrates using x-ray fluorescence nanoprobe is reported.  Ga and In maps reveal an inhomogeneous elemental distribution along the NWs, with a higher Ga concn. at the bottom of the NW.  SEM images show that the inhomogeneous axial distribution is not correlated with a x-ray beam induced damage, and therefore, should be an intrinsic characteristic of the NWs arising from the growth process.  Spatially resolved x-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy data acquired around the In K-edge show that the tetrahedral structure is preserved around the absorbing In-atoms all along the NW, and suggests that the compositional modulation could be affecting its long-range order.

      "Worldwide research activity at the nanoscale is triggering the appearance of new, and frequently surprising, materials properties in which the increasing importance of surface and interface effects plays a fundamental role.  This opens further possibilities in the development of new multifunctional materials with tuned phys. properties that do not arise together at the bulk scale.  Unfortunately, the std. methods currently available for solving the at. structure of bulk crystals fail for nanomaterials due to nanoscale effects (very small crystallite sizes, large surface-to-vol. ratio, near-surface relaxation, local lattice distortions etc.).  As a consequence, a crit. reexamn. of the available local-structure characterization methods is needed.  This work discusses the real possibilities and limits of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) anal. at the nanoscale.  To this end, the present state of the art for the interpretation of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) is described, including an advanced approach based on the use of classical mol. dynamics and its application to nickel oxide nanoparticles.  The limits and possibilities of X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) to det. several effects assocd. with the nanocryst. nature of materials are discussed in connection with the development of ZnO-based dil. magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) and iron oxide nanoparticles.\n",

      "In this work, we report on the compn., short- and long-range structural order of single mol. beam epitaxy grown InxGa1-xN nanowires using a hard X-ray synchrotron nanoprobe.  Nano-X-ray fluorescence mapping reveals an axial and radial heterogeneous elemental distribution in the single wires with Ga accumulation at their bottom and outer regions.  Polarization-dependent nano-X-ray absorption near edge structure demonstrates that despite the elemental modulation, the tetrahedral order around the Ga atoms remains along the nanowires.  Nano-X-ray diffraction mapping on single nanowires shows the existence of at least three different phases at their bottom: an In-poor shell and two In-rich phases.  The alloy homogenizes toward the top of the wires, where a single In-rich phase is obsd.  No signatures of In-metallic ppts. are obsd. in the diffraction spectra.  The In-content along the single nanowires estd. from X-ray fluorescence and diffraction data are in good agreement.  A rough picture of these phenomena is briefly presented.  We anticipate that this methodol. will contribute to a greater understanding of the underlying growth concepts not only of nanowires but also of many nanostructures in materials science.\n",

      "The usefulness of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles has led to their wide distribution in consumer products, despite only a limited understanding of how this nanomaterial behaves within biol. systems.  From a nanotoxicol. viewpoint the interaction(s) of ZnO nanoparticles with cells of the immune system is of specific interest, as these nanostructures are readily phagocytosed.  In this study, rapid scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy was used to assay the no. ZnO nanoparticles assocd. with ∼1000 individual THP-1 monocyte-derived human macrophages.  These data showed that nanoparticle-treated cells endured a 400% elevation in total Zn levels, 13-fold greater than the increase obsd. when incubated in the presence of an equitoxic concn. of ZnCl2.  Even after excluding the contribution of internalized nanoparticles, Zn levels in nanoparticle treated cells were raised ∼200% above basal levels.  As dissoln. of ZnO nanoparticles is crit. to their cytotoxic response, we utilized a strategy combining ion beam milling, X-ray fluorescence and SEM to directly probe the distribution and compn. of ZnO nanoparticles throughout the cellular interior.  This study demonstrated that correlative photon and ion beam imaging techniques can provide both high-resoln. and statistically powerful information on the biol. of metal oxide nanoparticles at the single-cell level.  Our approach promises ready application to broader studies of phenomena at the interface of nanotechnol. and biol.\n",

      "The high brilliance of third-generation synchrotron sources increases the demand for faster detectors to utilize the available flux.  The Maia detector is an advanced imaging scheme for energy-dispersive detection realizing dwell times per image-pixel as low as 50μs and count rates higher than 10 × 106 s-1.  In this article the integration of such a Maia detector in the Microprobe setup of beamline P06 at the storage ring PETRA III at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany, is described.  The anal. performance of the complete system in terms of rate-dependent energy resoln., scanning-speed-dependent spatial resoln. and lower limits of detection is characterized.  The potential of the Maia-based setup is demonstrated by key applications from materials science and chem., as well as environmental science with geol. applications and biol. questions that have been investigated at the P06 beamline.\n",

      "Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) have become std. tools to measure element concn., distribution at micrometer- to nanometer-scale, and speciation (e.g., nature of host phase; oxidn. state) in inhomogeneous geomaterials.  The new Maia X-ray detector system provides a quantum leap for the method in terms of data acquisition rate.  It is now possible to rapidly collect fully quant. maps of the distribution of major and trace elements at micrometer spatial resoln. over areas as large as 1 × 5 cm2.  Fast data acquisition rates also open the way to X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) imaging, in which spectroscopic information is available at each pixel in the map.  These capabilities are crit. for studying inhomogeneous Earth materials.  Using a 96-element prototype Maia detector, the authors imaged thin sections of an oxidized pisolitic regolith (2 × 4.5 mm2 at 2.5 × 2.5 μm2 pixel size) and a metamorphosed, sedimentary exhalative Mn-Fe ore (3.3 × 4 mm2 at 1.25 × 5 μm2).  In both cases, As K-edge XANES imaging reveals localized occurrence of reduced As in parts of these oxidized samples, which would have been difficult to recognize using traditional approaches.\n",

      "Besides conventional scanning X-ray fluorescence imaging at synchrotron sources, full-field X-ray fluorescence (FF-XRF) imaging techniques that do not implicitly require spatial scanning of the sample have become available.  FF-XRF has become achievable thanks to the development of a new type of energy dispersive CCD-based 2D detector, also referred to as a 'color X-ray camera (CXC)' or 'SLcam'.  We report on different imaging schemes for biol. samples using FF-XRF imaging: (a) 2D 'zoom' imaging with pinhole optics using the 'camera obscura' principle; (b) 2D 'fixed magnification' imaging using magnifying polycapillary optics; and (c) 3D-FF-XRF imaging using an X-ray sheet beam or computed tomog. (CT).  The different FF-XRF imaging modes are illustrated using the crustacean Daphnia magna, a model organism for investigating the effects of metals on organism/ecosystem health, and foraminifera, a class of amoeboid protist.  Detailed anal. characterization of the set-up is performed through analyzing various ref. materials in order to det. limits of detection (LODs) and sensitivities.  Expts. were performed using the BAMline at the BESSY synchrotron (Berlin, Germany) and using the P06 Hard X-ray Microprobe at the PETRAIII synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany).\n",

      "This review evaluates the role of dose rate on cell and mol. responses.  It focuses on the influence of dose rate on key events in crit. pathways in the development of cancer.  This approach is similar to that used by the U.  S. EPA and others to evaluate risk from chems.  It provides a mechanistic method to account for the influence of the dose rate from low-LET radiation, esp. in the low-dose region on cancer risk assessment.  Mol., cellular, and tissues changes are obsd. in many key events and change as a function of dose rate.  The magnitude and direction of change can be used to help establish an appropriate dose rate effectiveness factor (DREF).  Extensive data on key events suggest that exposure to low dose-rates are less effective in producing changes than high dose rates.  Most of these data at the mol. and cellular level support a large (2-30) DREF.  In addn., some evidence suggests that doses delivered at a low dose rate decrease damage to levels below that obsd. in the controls.  However, there are some data human and mechanistic data that support a dose-rate effectiveness factor of 1.  In summary, a review of the available mol., cellular and tissue data indicates that not only is dose rate an important variable in understanding radiation risk but it also supports the selection of a DREF greater than one as currently recommended by ICRP (2007) and BEIR VII (NRC/NAS 2006).\n",

      "BACKGROUND:  Although CT scans are very useful clinically, potential cancer risks exist from associated ionising radiation, in particular for children who are more radiosensitive than adults.  We aimed to assess the excess risk of leukaemia and brain tumours after CT scans in a cohort of children and young adults.  METHODS:  In our retrospective cohort study, we included patients without previous cancer diagnoses who were first examined with CT in National Health Service (NHS) centres in England, Wales, or Scotland (Great Britain) between 1985 and 2002, when they were younger than 22 years of age.  We obtained data for cancer incidence, mortality, and loss to follow-up from the NHS Central Registry from Jan 1, 1985, to Dec 31, 2008.  We estimated absorbed brain and red bone marrow doses per CT scan in mGy and assessed excess incidence of leukaemia and brain tumours cancer with Poisson relative risk models.  To avoid inclusion of CT scans related to cancer diagnosis, follow-up for leukaemia began 2 years after the first CT and for brain tumours 5 years after the first CT.  FINDINGS:  During follow-up, 74 of 178,604 patients were diagnosed with leukaemia and 135 of 176,587 patients were diagnosed with brain tumours.  We noted a positive association between radiation dose from CT scans and leukaemia (excess relative risk [ERR] per mGy 0·036, 95% CI 0·005-0·120; p=0·0097) and brain tumours (0·023, 0·010-0·049; p<0·0001).  Compared with patients who received a dose of less than 5 mGy, the relative risk of leukaemia for patients who received a cumulative dose of at least 30 mGy (mean dose 51·13 mGy) was 3·18 (95% CI 1·46-6·94) and the relative risk of brain cancer for patients who received a cumulative dose of 50-74 mGy (mean dose 60·42 mGy) was 2·82 (1·33-6·03).  INTERPRETATION:  Use of CT scans in children to deliver cumulative doses of about 50 mGy might almost triple the risk of leukaemia and doses of about 60 mGy might triple the risk of brain cancer.  Because these cancers are relatively rare, the cumulative absolute risks are small: in the 10 years after the first scan for patients younger than 10 years, one excess case of leukaemia and one excess case of brain tumour per 10,000 head CT scans is estimated to occur.  Nevertheless, although clinical benefits should outweigh the small absolute risks, radiation doses from CT scans ought to be kept as low as possible and alternative procedures, which do not involve ionising radiation, should be considered if appropriate.

      "Occupational X-ray examn. programs have been conducted in many countries to screen for occupational and nonoccupational respiratory diseases, resulting in widespread exposure to X-radiation.  We conducted a multicentre case-control study of lung cancer in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia and Slovakia, including 2,589 cases and 2,859 controls enrolled during 1998-2002.  We collected detailed information on occupational X-ray examns., occupations and tobacco smoking.  We calcd. odds ratios of lung cancer via multiple logistic regression after adjustment for age, sex, center and tobacco smoking.  Among controls 24.9% reported no X-ray examn., 62.9% reported 1-30 examns. and 12.2% reported more than 30 examns.  When we chose individuals with no examn. as the ref. group, the odds ratios of lung cancer were 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.48), 1.33 (95% CI 1.08-1.64), 1.49 (95% CI 1.18-1.87), 1.52 (95% CI 1.17-1.99) and 2.15 (95% CI 1.50-3.08) for 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40 and more than 40 examns., resp. (p-value of test for linear trend <0.0001).  The assocn. between X-ray examns. and lung cancer risk was strong in countries with low prevalence of exposure and absent in countries with high prevalence of exposure.  Odds ratios for X-ray examns. were lower among smokers than among nonsmokers.  The magnitude of the increased risk obsd. is higher than expected on the basis of other studies of radiation-exposed populations.  Although the assocn. we detected between X-ray examns. and lung cancer risk may reflect a carcinogenic effect of repeated exposure to low-level ionizing radiation, reporting bias and particularly uncontrolled confounding by occupational exposure to carcinogens are also likely explanations of the results.\n",

      "Normal tissue responses to ionizing radiation have been a major subject for study since the discovery of X-rays at the end of the 19th century.  Shortly thereafter, time-dose relationships were established for some normal tissue endpoints that led to investigations into how the size of dose per fraction and the quality of radiation affected outcome.  The assessment of the radiosensitivity of bone marrow stem cells using colony-forming assays by Till and McCulloch prompted the establishment of in situ clonogenic assays for other tissues that added to the radiobiology toolbox.  These clonogenic and functional endpoints enabled mathematical modeling to be performed that elucidated how tissue structure, and in particular turnover time, impacted clinically relevant fractionated radiation schedules.  More recently, lineage tracing technology, advanced imaging and single cell sequencing have shed further light on the behavior of cells within stem, and other, cellular compartments, both in homeostasis and after radiation damage.  The discovery of heterogeneity within the stem cell compartment and plasticity in response to injury have added new dimensions to the consideration of radiation-induced tissue damage.  Clinically, radiobiology of the 20th century garnered wisdom relevant to photon treatments delivered to a fairly wide field at around 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week, for 5-7 weeks.  Recently, the scope of radiobiology has been extended by advances in technology, imaging and computing, as well as by the use of charged particles.  These allow radiation to be delivered more precisely to tumors while minimizing the amount of normal tissue receiving high doses.  One result has been an increase in the use of schedules with higher doses per fraction given in a shorter time frame (hypofractionation).  We are unable to cover these new technologies in detail in this review, just as we must omit low-dose stochastic effects, and many aspects of dose, dose rate and radiation quality.  We argue that structural diversity and plasticity within tissue compartments provides a general context for discussion of most radiation responses, while acknowledging many omissions. © 2020 The Authors.

      "A wide variety of radiation-induced deterministic skin effects have been observed after X-ray guided interventions ranging from mild effects, such as transient erythema or temporary epilation, to severe effects, such as desquamation and necrosis.  Radiation biologists have identified, in addition to absorbed dose to the skin, other factors that strongly influence the type and severity of a skin reaction, including exposure-related factors (dose rate, fractionation, the size of the exposed area and its site), biological factors (age, oxygen status, capillary density, hormonal status and genetic factors) and ethnic differences.  A peak entrance skin dose of 2 Gy is an arbitrary, but pragmatic, threshold for radiation-induced skin effects after X-ray guided interventions.  Transient skin injury originating in the epidermis is not expected in the average patient population at peak entrance skin doses up to 6 Gy.  Serious skin effects are not likely to occur in clinical practice when optimised X-ray equipment is used in combination with good techniques for fluoroscopy and imaging.  However, this might not be true for patients with biological factors that are associated with an increased sensitivity for radiation-induced skin reactions.\n",

      "The skin is an external organ that is most frequently exposed to radiation.  High-dose radiation initiates and promotes acute radiation injury.  Thus, it is important to investigate the influence of high-dose radiation exposure on the skin at the mol. level.  The post-translational modification of p53 plays a central role in radiation responses, including apoptosis and cell growth arrest.  Although it is well known that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) can phosphorylate Ser15/Ser18 of p53 in vitro, the post-translational modification pattern and the modifier of p53 in the skin after exposure to high-dose X-rays are not yet well understood.  Here we show that the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15/Ser18, as well as the phosphorylation of histone H2AX on Ser139, was detected in the keratinocytes of the mouse skin and human skin models after high-dose x-ray irradn.  Following high-dose x-ray irradn., both proteins were also phosphorylated in the skin keratinocytes of both ATM gene knockout mice and DNA-PK-deficient SCID mice.\n",

      "BACKGROUND:  Radiation therapy is generally contraindicated for cancer patients with collagen vascular diseases (CVD) such as scleroderma due to an increased risk of fibrosis.  The tight skin (TSK) mouse has skin which, in some respects, mimics that of patients with scleroderma.  The skin radiation response of TSK mice has not been previously reported.  If TSK mice are shown to have radiation sensitive skin, they may prove to be a useful model to examine the mechanisms underlying skin radiation injury, protection, mitigation and treatment.  METHODS:  The hind limbs of TSK and parental control C57BL/6 mice received a radiation exposure sufficient to cause approximately the same level of acute injury.  Endpoints included skin damage scored using a non-linear, semi-quantitative scale and tissue fibrosis assessed by measuring passive leg extension.  In addition, TGF-beta1 cytokine levels were measured monthly in skin tissue.  RESULTS:  Contrary to our expectations, TSK mice were more resistant (i.e. 20%) to radiation than parental control mice.  Although acute skin reactions were similar in both mouse strains, radiation injury in TSK mice continued to decrease with time such that several months after radiation there was significantly less skin damage and leg contraction compared to C57BL/6 mice (p < 0.05).  Consistent with the expected association of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) with late tissue injury, levels of the cytokine were significantly higher in the skin of the C57BL/6 mouse compared to TSK mouse at all time points (p < 0.05).  CONCLUSION:  TSK mice are not recommended as a model of scleroderma involving radiation injury.  The genetic and molecular basis for reduced radiation injury observed in TSK mice warrants further investigation particularly to identify mechanisms capable of reducing tissue fibrosis after radiation injury.\n",

      "The aim of the present study was to establish a rat model of local and systemic bone injury by focal irradn., in order to study the etiol. mechanism and intervention.  Furthermore, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were isolated and induced to osteoclasts.  It has been demonstrated that a single dose of 2 Gy may result in a significant loss of lumbar bone d. at 3 days post-irradn., however this is restored at 30 days post-irradn.  In the 3x8 Gy irradn. rat model, there was a rapid decrease in the aBMd of lumbar spine at 3 days and at 7 days post-irradn., and the aBMd decline persisted even at 60 days post-irradn.  In addn., microcT anal. revealed a persistent decline in bone vol. and damage in microarchitecture in the 3x8 Gy irradn. model, accompanied by a decrease in MAR, index of the decline in bone-forming ability.  In the cellular mechanism, a single 2 Gy local irradn. mainly manifested as an enhancement of the BMMs osteoclastogenesis potential, which was different from the osteoclastogenesis inhibition after high-dose focal irradn. (3x8 Gy).  In summary, the irradn. with simulated clin. focal fractionated radiotherapy exerts short- and long-term systemic injury on bone tissue, characterized by different osteoclastogenesis potential between the high dose mode and a single 2 Gy focal irradn.  Physicians must consider the irreversibility of bone damage in clin. radiotherapy.\n",

      "The development of circular RNA (circRNA) microarrays has facilitated studies on the role of circRNAs in regulating gene expression through a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network.  In our study, a microarray was used to detect the expression profiles of circRNAs in mouse bone marrow stromal cell (MSCs) after total body irradn. (TBI) in an X-ray field.  Forty mice were randomly distributed into two groups, the control group and the TBI group, with 20 mice in each.  Using circRNA microarray data, we compared the circRNA expression profiles in the MSCs between the two groups.  Randomly chosen differentially expressed circRNAs were validated as potential TBI biomarkers.  Overall, 148 circRNAs were significantly upregulated while the other 133 were downregulated between the TBI group and the sham group.  Among them, two upregulated circRNAs (mmu_circRNA_011235 and mmu_circRNA_016901) and three downregulated circRNAs (mmu_circRNA_008488, mmu_circRNA_000551 and mmu_circRNA_005365) exhibited trends comparable to microarray data in the validation expts.  The miRNA support vector regression method was used to predict potential target miRNAs for the circRNAs while ClueGO was used for functional anal. of predicted miRNA target genes.  This is the first study to investigate the differential circRNA expression profile in TBI and the assocd. functions.  Significantly upregulated or downregulated circRNAs may represent novel biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for the clin. management of radiation injury with TBI.\n",

Binary structures with cryst. order were obtained, adopting a tetragonal lattice.  Moreover, the cavity of the engineered protein containers can be filled with inorg. nanoparticles.  The controlled assembly of these protein-nanoparticle composites yields highly ordered binary nanoparticle superlattices as free-standing crystals, with up to a few hundred micrometers in size.  Because the structure and lattice parameters of the protein-nanoparticle crystals are independent of their nanoparticle cargo, the binary protein material may serve as a generally applicable matrix for the assembly of a variety of nanoparticles types.\n",

      "With the continuing development of beamlines for macromol. crystallog. (MX) over the last few years providing ever higher X-ray flux densities, it has become even more important to be aware of the effects of radiation damage on the resulting structures.  Nine papers in this issue cover a range of aspects related to the physics and chem. of the manifestations of this damage, as obsd. in both MX and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on crystals, solns. and tissue samples.  The reports include measurements of the heating caused by X-ray irradn. in ruby microcrystals, low-dose expts. examg. damage rates as a function of incident X-ray energy up to 30 keV on a metallo-enzyme using a CdTe detector of high quantum efficiency as well as a theor. anal. of the gains predicted in diffraction efficiency using these detectors, a SAXS examn. of low-dose radiation exposure effects on the dissocn. of a protein complex related to human health, theor. calcns. describing radiation chem. pathways which aim to explain the specific structural damage widely obsd. in proteins, investigation of radiation-induced damage effects in a DNA crystal, a case study on a metallo-enzyme where structural movements thought to be mechanism related might actually be radiation-damage-induced changes, and finally a review describing what X-ray radiation-induced cysteine modifications can teach us about protein dynamics and catalysis.  These papers, along with some other relevant literature published since the last Journal of Synchrotron Radiation Radiation Damage special issue in 2017, are briefly summarized below.\n",

Radiation damage inflicted during diffraction data collection in macromol. crystallog. has re-emerged in the last decade as a major exptl. and computational challenge, as even for crystals held at 100 K it can result in severe data-quality degrdn. and the appearance in solved structures of artifacts which affect biol. interpretations.  Here, the observable symptoms and basic phys. processes involved in radiation damage are described and the concept of absorbed dose as the basic metric against which to monitor the exptl. obsd. changes is outlined.

      "A review.  Many advances in the understanding of radiation damage to protein crystals, particularly at cryogenic temps., have been made in recent years, but with this comes an expanding literature, and, to the new breed of protein crystallographer who is not really interested in X-ray physics or radiation chem. but just wants to solve a biol. relevant structure, the tech. nature and breadth of this literature can be daunting.  The purpose of this paper is to serve as a rough guide to radiation damage issues, and to provide refs. to the more exacting and detailed work.  No attempt has been made to report precise nos. (a factor of two is considered satisfactory), and, since there are aspects of radiation damage that are demonstrably unpredictable, the 'worst case scenario' as well as the 'av. crystal' are discussed in terms of the practicalities of data collection.\n",

      "Radiation damage to cryocooled protein crystals during x-ray structure detn. has become an inherent part of macromol. diffraction data collection at third-generation synchrotrons.  Generally, radiation damage is an undesirable component of the expt. and can result in erroneous structural detail in the final model.  The characterization of radiation damage thus has become an important area for structural biologists.  The calcd. dose limit of 2 × 107 Gy for the diffracting power of cryocooled protein crystals to drop by half has been exptl. evaluated at a third-generation synchrotron source.  Successive data sets were collected from four holoferritin and three apoferritin crystals.  The absorbed dose for each crystal was calcd. by using the program RADDOSE after measurement of the incident photon flux and detn. of the elemental crystal compn. by microparticle-induced x-ray emission.  Degrdn. in diffraction quality and specific structural changes induced by synchrotron radiation then could be compared directly with absorbed dose for different dose/dose rate regimes: a 10% lifetime decrease for a 10-fold dose rate increase was obsd.  Remarkable agreement both between different crystals of the same type and between apoferritin and holoferritin was obsd. for the dose required to reduce the diffracted intensity by half (D1/2).  From these measurements, a dose limit of D1/2 = 4.3 (±0.3) × 107 Gy was obtained.  However, by considering other data quality indicators, an intensity redn. to Iln2 = ln2 × I0, corresponding to an absorbed dose of 3.0 × 107 Gy, is recommended as an appropriate dose limit for typical macromol. crystallog. expts.\n",

      "We report a new method to probe the solid-liq. interface through the use of a thin liq. layer on a solid surface.  An ambient pressure XPS (AP-XPS) endstation that is capable of detecting high kinetic energy photoelectrons (7 keV) at a pressure up to 110 Torr has been constructed and commissioned.  Addnl., we have deployed a \"dip & pull\" method to create a stable nanometers-thick aq. electrolyte on platinum working electrode surface.  Combining the newly constructed AP-XPS system, \"dip & pull\" approach, with a \"tender\" X-ray synchrotron source (2 keV-7 keV), we are able to access the interface between liq. and solid dense phases with photoelectrons and directly probe important phenomena occurring at the narrow solid-liq. interface region in an electrochem. system.  Using this approach, we have performed electrochem. oxidn. of the Pt electrode at an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential.  Under this potential, we observe the formation of both Pt2+ and Pt4+ interfacial species on the Pt working electrode in situ.  We believe this thin-film approach and the use of \"tender\" AP-XPS highlighted in this study is an innovative new approach to probe this key solid-liq. interface region of electrochem.\n",

      "An approach is demonstrated to obtain, in a sample- and time-efficient manner, multiple dose-resolved crystal structures from room-temp. protein microcrystals using identical fixed-target supports at both synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs).  This approach allows direct comparison of dose-resolved serial synchrotron and damage-free XFEL serial femtosecond crystallog. structures of radiation-sensitive proteins.  Specifically, serial synchrotron structures of a heme peroxidase enzyme reveal that X-ray induced changes occur at far lower doses than those at which diffraction quality is compromised (the Garman limit), consistent with previous studies on the redn. of heme proteins by low X-ray doses.  In these structures, a functionally relevant bond length is shown to vary rapidly as a function of absorbed dose, with all room-temp. synchrotron structures exhibiting linear deformation of the active site compared with the XFEL structure.  It is demonstrated that extrapolation of dose-dependent synchrotron structures to zero dose can closely approx. the damage-free XFEL structure.  This approach is widely applicable to any protein where the crystal structure is altered by the synchrotron X-ray beam and provides a soln. to the urgent requirement to det. intact structures of such proteins in a high-throughput and accessible manner.\n",

At the at. scale, besides the (Auger and photo) electron transport in the bulk or the ejection into the surrounding media, special attention in devoted to the specific consequences of the initial Auger decay mechanism.  At the macroscopic scale, the decisive role of the poor electronic cond. of the radiation-sensitive materials is outlined and the damaging effects occur in irradiated insulators because the lack of conduction electrons prevents the initial charge of the excited atoms being quickly restored.  Correlating irradn. conditions and phys. properties of the specimen, various expressions are proposed for the 1st time to quantify these effects.  Some are neither dose-nor dose-rate-dependent and the influence of the surrounding medium is also considered.  The fundamental mechanisms studied here hold for a wide variety of specimens or components studied in x-ray microscopy.  Their consequences can be easily transposed to other techniques using transmitted x-rays.\n",

      "X-ray radiation damage of lysozyme single crystals by an intense monochromatic beam from the Advanced Photon Source was studied at cryogenic temps. of 40-150 K.  The results confirmed that primary radiation damage was both linearly dependent on the x-ray dose and independent of temp.  The upper limit for the primary radiation damage obsd. in the authors' previous study [T. Teng and K. Moffat (2000)] held over the wider temp. range of this study.  The x-ray diffraction quality of the data acquired at 40 K was superior to those at 100 K, apparently due to temp. dependence of secondary and tertiary radiation damage and to reduced thermal motion.\n",

      "X-ray diffraction microscopy (XDM) is a new form of X-ray imaging that is being practiced at several third-generation synchrotron-radiation X-ray facilities.  Nine years have elapsed since the technique was first introduced and it has made rapid progress in demonstrating high-resoln. three-dimensional imaging and promises few-nanometer resoln. with much larger samples than can be imaged in the transmission electron microscope.  Both life- and materials-science applications of XDM are intended, and it is expected that the principal limitation to resoln. will be radiation damage for life science and the coherent power of available X-ray sources for material science.  In this paper we address the question of the role of radiation damage.  We use a statistical anal. based on the so-called \"dose fractionation theorem\" of Hegerl and Hoppe to calc. the dose needed to make an image of a single life-science sample by XDM with a given resoln.  We find that the needed dose scales with the inverse fourth power of the resoln. and present exptl. evidence to support this finding.  To det. the max. tolerable dose we have assembled a no. of data taken from the literature plus some measurements of our own which cover ranges of resoln. that are not well covered otherwise.  The conclusion of this study is that, based on the natural contrast between protein and water and \"Rose-criterion\" image quality, one should be able to image a frozen-hydrated biol. sample using XDM at a resoln. of about 10 nm.\n",

      "Flow cytometry and cell sorting techniques have been used together with repeated measurement in an attempt to define better the radiation survival response of asynchronously dividing Chinese hamster V79-171 cells under aerobic and hypoxic conditions.  Although the first two decades of cell inactivation have been examined, particular attention has been given to the low-dose range of a few grays, as used in individual radiation therapy treatments.  A single linear-quadratic dose-response function was consistently unable to fit both the low-dose and high-dose data satisfactorily, suggesting a two-component response.  Separate fitting of the low-dose and high-dose portions of the response yielded alpha and beta values which differed significantly (P = 0.001 to 0.002).  The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the observed substructure simply reflects the presence of subpopulations of sensitive (G1-, G2-phase) and resistant (late S-phase) cells, which are resolved in these measurements.  These results may have significance for certain situations in radiation therapy and in biophysical modeling of the radiation response.\n",

      "X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy features unique capabilities which make it well suited for biol. investigations.  Its high sensitivity together with high spatial resoln. and penetration depth provide a unique tool for trace elements anal. in heterogeneous samples.  Like most of the x-ray based techniques, radiation damage sets hard limits on the ultimate performance.  Although the interactions between matter and photons are well described from a physics point-of-view, there is a lack of exptl. data, in particular for XRF imaging mode.  In this context, this work proposes a practical approach in addressing the limits set by radiation damage to x-ray fluorescence imaging in the case of hydrated and unfixed cells at room temp.  The max. dose tolerated by ascidian blood cells is 105 Gy.  A simple theor. model allowed the minimal doses required for a good image contrast to be detd. for various exptl. schemes.  The results are consistent with the exptl. observation on ascidian blood cells which exemplifies the peculiar case of highly concd. samples (>10,000 ppm) at room temp.  The same simple model predicts that in the case of the detection of high Z trace elements in cryopreserved cells, the relative detection limit set by radiation damage is below 0.1 ppm at a spatial resoln. of 100 nm.\n",

Above the threshold of approx. 1 × 107 Gy, excessive damage of the crystal develops which is interpreted as the onset of secondary and/or tertiary radiation damage.  This upper limit of X-ray dose is compared with Henderson's limit [Henderson (1990) Proc. R. Soc. London, B241, 6-8], and its implication for the amt. of useful X-ray diffraction data that can be obtained for crystals of a given scattering power is also discussed.\n",

      "The resoln. of transmission x-ray microscopes (TXMs) using zone plate optics is presently about 30 nm.  Theory and expts. presented here show that this resoln. can be obtained in radiation sensitive hydrated biol. material by using shock frozen samples.  For this purpose the interaction of X-rays with matter and the image formation with zone plates is described.  For the first time the influence of the limited apertures of the condenser and the zone plate objective are in included in calcns. of the image contrast, the photon d. and radiation dose required for the object illumination.  Model considerations show that lowest radiation dose and high image contrast are obtained in optimized phase contrast which exploits absorption as well as phase shift.  The damaging effect of the absorbed X-rays is quant. evaluated by radiation-induced kinetics showing that cryogenic samples are structurally stable.  To verify these theor. models the TXM was modified to allow imaging of frozen-hydrated samples at atm. pressure.  Details inside cells and algae as small as 35 nm are visible at 2.4 nm wavelength in amplitude contrast mode.  At this resoln. the cryogenic samples show no structural changes.  As predicted, optimized phase contrast shows structures inside the frozen-hydrated objects with high contrast.  Stereo-pair images of algae reveal the 3D organization of the organelles.  Element anal. and micro-tomog. of whole cryogenic cells are possible.\n",

      "Hard X-ray fluorescence microscopy is one of the most sensitive techniques for performing trace elemental anal. of biol. samples such as whole cells and tissues.  Conventional sample prepn. methods usually involve dehydration, which removes cellular water and may consequently cause structural collapse, or invasive processes such as embedding.  Radiation-induced artifacts may also become an issue, particularly as the spatial resoln. increases beyond the sub-micrometer scale.  To allow imaging under hydrated conditions, close to the 'natural state', as well as to reduce structural radiation damage, the Bionanoprobe (BNP) has been developed, a hard X-ray fluorescence nanoprobe with cryogenic sample environment and cryo transfer capabilities, dedicated to studying trace elements in frozen-hydrated biol. systems.  The BNP is installed at an undulator beamline at sector 21 of the Advanced Photon Source.  It provides a spatial resoln. of 30 nm for two-dimensional fluorescence imaging.  In this first demonstration the instrument design and motion control principles are described, the instrument performance is quantified, and the first results obtained with the BNP on frozen-hydrated whole cells are reported.\n",

      "Synchrotron radiation based nanoscopic X-ray fluorescence (SR nano-XRF) anal. can visualize trace level elemental distribution in a fully quant. manner within single cells.  However, in-air XRF anal. requires chem. fixation modifying the cell's chem. compn.  Here, we describe first nanoscopic XRF anal. upon cryogenically frozen (-150°C) fibroblasts at the ID16A-NI 'Nano-imaging' end-station located at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (France).  Fibroblast cells were obtained from skin biopsies from control and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) patients.  FRDA is an autosomal recessive disorder with dysregulation of iron metab. as a key feature.  By means of the X-ray Fundamental Parameter (FP) method, including absorption correction of the ice layer deposited onto the fibroblasts, background-cor. mass fraction elemental maps of P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe and Zn of entire cryofrozen human fibroblasts were obtained.  Despite the presence of diffracting microcrystals in the vitreous ice matrix and minor sample radiation damage effects, clusters of iron-rich hot-spots with similar mass fractions were found in the cytoplasm of both control and FRDA fibroblasts.  Interestingly, no significant difference in the mean iron concn. was found in the cytoplasm of FRDA fibroblasts, but a significant decrease in zinc concn.  This finding might underscore metal dysregulation, beyond iron, in cells derived from FRDA patients.  In conclusion, although currently having slightly increased limits of detection (LODs) compared to non-cryogenic mode, SR based nanoscopic XRF under cryogenic sample conditions largely obliterates the debate on chem. sample preservation and provides a unique tool for trace level elemental imaging in single cells close to their native state with a superior spatial resoln. of 20 nm.\n",

      "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generally accepted to be the most biol. significant lesion by which ionizing radiation causes cancer and hereditary disease.  However, no information on the induction and processing of DSBs after physiol. relevant radiation doses is available.  Many of the methods used to measure DSB repair inadvertently introduce this form of damage as part of the methodol., and hence are limited in their sensitivity.  Here we present evidence that foci of γ-H2AX (a phosphorylated histone), detected by immunofluorescence, are quant. the same as DSBs and are capable of quantifying the repair of individual DSBs.  This finding allows the investigation of DSB repair after radiation doses as low as 1 mGy, an improvement by several orders of magnitude over current methods.  Surprisingly, DSBs induced in cultures of nondividing primary human fibroblasts by very low radiation doses (≈1 mGy) remain unrepaired for many days, in strong contrast to efficient DSB repair that is obsd. at higher doses.  However, the level of DSBs in irradiated cultures decreases to that of unirradiated cell cultures if the cells are allowed to proliferate after irradn., and we present evidence that this effect may be caused by an elimination of the cells carrying unrepaired DSBs.  The results presented are in contrast to current models of risk assessment that assume that cellular responses are equally efficient at low and high doses, and provide the opportunity to employ γ-H2AX foci formation as a direct biomarker for human exposure to low quantities of ionizing radiation.\n",

      "To observe the adaptive response (AR) induced by ionizing radiation in human fibroblasts under monolayer and 3-dimensional (3-D) condition.  Three kinds of fibroblasts were cultured under both monolayer and 3-D condition.  Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect the γ-H2AX foci and the morphol. texture.  Trypan blue staining was used to detect the cell death.  Western blot was used to detect the expressions of γ-H2AX, p53 and CDKN1A/p21 (p21).  We found that DNA damage increased in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner after high doses of radiation.  When cells were pretreated with a priming low dose of radiation followed by high dose radiation, DNA damage was attenuated under both monolayer and 3-D condition, and the adaptive response (AR) was induced.  Addnl., the morphol. of cells under monolayer and 3-D conditions were different, and radiation also induced AR according to morphol. texture anal.  Priming low dose radiation induced AR both under monolayer and 3-D condition.  Interestingly, 3-D microenvironment made cells more sensitive to radiation.  The expression of p53 and p21 was changed and indicated that they might participate in the regulation of AR.\n",

      "There has been enormous recent progress in understanding how human cells respond to oxidative stress, such as that caused by exposure to ionizing radiation.  We have witnessed a significant deciphering of the events that underlie how antioxidant responses counter pro-oxidant damage to key biol. targets in all cellular compartments, including the genome and mitochondria.  These cytoprotective responses include: 1.  The basal cellular repertoire of antioxidant capabilities and its supporting cast of facilitator enzymes; and 2.  The inducible phase of the antioxidant response, notably that mediated by the Nrf2 transcription factor.  There has also been frenetic progress in defining how reactive electrophilic species swamp existing protective mechanisms to augment DNA damage, events that are embodied in the cellular \"DNA-damage response\", including cell cycle checkpoint activation and DNA repair, which occur on a time scale of hours to days, as well as the implementation of cellular responses such as apoptosis, autophagy, senescence and reprograming that extend the time period of damage sensing and response into weeks, months and years.  It has become apparent that, in addn. to the initial oxidative insult, cells typically undergo further waves of secondary reactive oxygen/nitrogen species generation, DNA damage and signaling and that these may reemerge long after the initial events have subsided, probably being driven, at least in part, by persisting DNA damage.  These reactive oxygen/nitrogen species are an integral part of the pathol. consequences of radiation exposure and may persist across multiple cell divisions.  Because of the pervasive nature of oxidative stress, a cell will manifest different responses in different subcellular compartments and to different levels of stress injury.  Aspects of these compartmentalized responses can involve the same proteins (such as ATM, p53 and p21) but in different functional guises, e.g., in cytoplasmic vs. nuclear responses or in early- vs. late-phase events.  Many of these responses involve gene activation and new protein synthesis as well as a plethora of post-translational modifications of both basal and induced response proteins.  It is these responses that we focus on in this review.\n",

      "The immune system has the power to modulate the expression of radiation-induced normal and tumor tissue damage.  On the one hand, it can contribute to cancer cure, and on the other hand, it can influence acute and late radiation side effects, which in many ways resemble acute and chronic inflammatory disease states.  The way radiation-induced inflammation feeds into adaptive antigen-specific immune responses adds another dimension to the tumor-host cross talk during radiation therapy and to possible radiation-driven autoimmune responses.  Understanding how radiation affects inflammation and immunity is therefore critical if we are to effectively manipulate these forces for benefit in radiation oncology treatments.\n",

      "A review.  Therapeutic irradn. of the tumor microenvironment causes differential activation of pro-survival and pro-death pathways in malignant, stromal, endothelial and immune cells, hence causing a profound cellular and biol. reconfiguration via multiple, non-redundant mechanisms.  Such mechanisms include the selective elimination of particularly radiosensitive cell types and consequent loss of specific cellular functions, the local release of cytokines and danger signals by dying radiosensitive cells, and altered cytokine secretion by surviving radioresistant cells.  Altogether, these processes create chemotactic and immunomodulatory cues for incoming and resident immune cells.  Here we discuss how cytoprotective and cytotoxic signaling modules activated by radiation in specific cell populations reshape the immunol. tumor microenvironment.\n",

      "A review.  Radiation is an important component of cancer treatment with more than half of all patients receive radiotherapy during their cancer experience.  While the impact of radiation on tumor morphol. is routinely examd. in the pre-clin. and clin. setting, the impact of radiation on the tumor microenvironment and more specifically the inflammatory/immune response is less well characterized.  Inflammation is a key contributor to short- and long-term cancer eradication, with significant tumor and normal tissue consequences.  Therefore, the role of radiation in modulating the inflammatory response is highly topical given the current wave of targeted and immuno-therapeutic treatments for cancer.  This review provides a general overview of how radiation modulates the inflammatory and immune response-(i) how radiation induces the inflammatory/immune system, (ii) the cellular changes that take place, (iii) how radiation dose delivery affects the immune response, and (iv) a discussion on research directions to improve patient survival, reduce side effects, improve quality of life, and reduce financial costs in the immediate future.  Harnessing the benefits of radiation on the immune response will enhance its maximal therapeutic benefit and reduce radiation-induced toxicity.\n",

      "A review.  Cellular exposure to ionizing radiation leads to oxidizing events that alter at. structure through direct interactions of radiation with target macromols. or via products of water radiolysis.  Further, the oxidative damage may spread from the targeted to neighboring, non-targeted bystander cells through redox-modulated intercellular communication mechanisms.  To cope with the induced stress and the changes in the redox environment, organisms elicit transient responses at the mol., cellular and tissue levels to counteract toxic effects of radiation.  Metabolic pathways are induced during and shortly after the exposure.  Depending on radiation dose, dose-rate and quality, these protective mechanisms may or may not be sufficient to cope with the stress.  When the harmful effects exceed those of homeostatic biochem. processes, induced biol. changes persist and may be propagated to progeny cells.  Physiol. levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species play crit. roles in many cellular functions.  In irradiated cells, levels of these reactive species may be increased due to perturbations in oxidative metab. and chronic inflammatory responses, thereby contributing to the long-term effects of exposure to ionizing radiation on genomic stability.  Here, in addn. to immediate biol. effects of water radiolysis on DNA damage, we also discuss the role of mitochondria in the delayed outcomes of ionization radiation.  Defects in mitochondrial functions lead to accelerated aging and numerous pathol. conditions.  Different types of radiation vary in their linear energy transfer (LET) properties, and we discuss their effects on various aspects of mitochondrial physiol.  These include short and long-term in vitro and in vivo effects on mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial protein import and metabolic and antioxidant enzymes.\n",

      "Medical imaging has become a central component of patient care to ensure early and accurate diagnosis.  Unfortunately, many imaging modalities use ionizing radiation to generate images.  Ionizing radiation even in low doses can cause direct DNA damage and generate reactive oxygen species and free radicals, leading to DNA, protein, and lipid membrane damage.  This cell damage can lead to apoptosis, necrosis, teratogenesis, or carcinogenesis.  As many as 2% of cancers (and an assocd. 15,000 deaths annually) can be linked to computed tomog. exposure alone.  Radio-protective agents have been investigated using various models including cells, animals, and recently humans.  The data suggest that radioprotective agents working through a variety of mechanisms have the potential to decrease free radical damage produced by ionizing radiation.  Radioprotective agents may be useful as an adjunct to medical imaging to reduced patient morbidity and mortality due to ionizing radiation exposure.  Some radioprotective agents can be found in high quantities in antioxidant rich foods, suggesting that a specific diet recommendation could be beneficial in radioprotection.\n",

      "A review.  Radiotherapy is one of the major therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.  In the past decade, there has been growing interest in using high Z (at. no.) elements (materials) as radiosensitizers.  New strategies in nanomedicine could help to improve cancer diagnosis and therapy at cellular and mol. levels.  Metal-based nanoparticles usually exhibit chem. inertness in cellular and subcellular systems and may play a role in radiosensitization and synergistic cell-killing effects for radiation therapy.  This review summarizes the efficacy of metal-based NanoEnhancers against cancers in both in vitro and in vivo systems for a range of ionizing radiations including gamma-rays, X-rays, and charged particles.  The potential of translating preclin. studies on metal-based nanoparticles-enhanced radiation therapy into clin. practice is also discussed using examples of several metal-based NanoEnhancers (such as CYT-6091, AGuIX, and NBTXR3).  Also, a few general examples of theranostic multimetallic nanocomposites are presented, and the related biol. mechanisms are discussed.\n",

      "Pathol. complete response to preoperative treatment in adults with soft-tissue sarcoma can be achieved in only a few patients receiving radiotherapy.  This phase 2-3 trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of the hafnium oxide (HfO2) nanoparticle NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone as a pre-operative treatment in patients with locally advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.Act.In.  Sarc is a phase 2-3 randomised, multicentre, international trial.  Adults (aged ≥18 years) with locally advanced soft-tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk wall, of any histol. grade, and requiring preoperative radiotherapy were included.  Patients had to have a WHO performance status of 0-2 and a life expectancy of at least 6 mo.  Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive web response system to receive either NBTXR3 (vol. corresponding to 10% of baseline tumor vol. at a fixed concn. of 53·3 g/L) as a single intratumoral administration before preoperative external-beam radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) or radiotherapy alone, followed by surgery.  Randomisation was stratified by histol. subtype (myxoid liposarcoma vs others).  This was an open-label study.  The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a pathol. complete response, assessed by a central pathol. review board following European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer guidelines in the intention-to-treat population full anal. set.  Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one puncture and injection of NBTXR3 or at least one dose of radiotherapy.  This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT02379845, and is ongoing for long-term follow-up, but recruitment is complete.  Between March 3, 2015, and Nov 21, 2017, 180 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned and 179 started treatment: 89 in the NBTXR3 plus radiotherapy group and 90 in the radiotherapy alone group.  Two patients in the NBTXR3 group and one patient in the radiotherapy group were excluded from the efficacy anal. because they were subsequently discovered to be ineligible; thus, a total of 176 patients were analyzed for the primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat full anal. set (87 in the NBTXR3 group and 89 in the radiotherapy alone group).  A pathol. complete response was noted in 14 (16%) of 87 patients in the NBTXR3 group and seven (8%) of 89 in the radiotherapy alone group (p=0·044).  In both treatment groups, the most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse event was postoperative wound complication (eight [9%] of 89 patients in the NBTXR3 group and eight [9%] of 90 in the radiotherapy alone group).  The most common grade 3-4 adverse events related to NBTXR3 administration were injection site pain (four [4%] of 89) and hypotension (four [4%]) and the most common grade 3-4 radiotherapy-related adverse event was radiation skin injury in both groups (five [6%] of 89 in the NBTXR3 group and four [4%] of 90 in the radiotherapy alone group).  The most common treatment-emergent grade 3-4 adverse event related to NBTXR3 was hypotension (six [7%] of 89 patients).  Serious adverse events were obsd. in 35 (39%) of 89 patients in the NBTXR3 group and 27 (30%) of 90 patients in the radiotherapy alone group.  No treatment-related deaths occurred.  This trial validates the mode of action of this new class of radioenhancer, which potentially opens a large field of clin. applications in soft-tissue sarcoma and possibly other cancers.\n",

      "X-ray fluorescence computed tomog. (XFCT) is a technique that can identify, quantify, and locate elements within objects by detecting x-ray fluorescence (characteristic x-rays) stimulated by an excitation source, typically derived from a synchrotron.  However, the use of a synchrotron limits practicality and accessibility of XFCT for routine biomedical imaging applications.  Therefore, we have developed the ability to perform XFCT on a benchtop setting with ordinary polychromatic x-ray sources.  Here, we report our postmortem study that demonstrates the use of benchtop XFCT to accurately image the distribution of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) injected into a tumor-bearing mouse.  The distribution of GNPs as detd. by benchtop XFCT was validated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  This investigation shows drastically enhanced sensitivity and specificity of GNP detection and quantification with benchtop XFCT, up to two orders of magnitude better than conventional x-ray CT.  The results also reaffirm the unique capabilities of benchtop XFCT for simultaneous detn. of the spatial distribution and concn. of nonradioactive metallic probes, such as GNPs, within the context of small animal imaging.  Overall, this investigation identifies a clear path toward in vivo mol. imaging using benchtop XFCT techniques in conjunction with GNPs and other metallic probes.\n",

      "A particular challenge for nanotoxicol. is the evaluation of the biol. fate and toxicity of nanomaterials that dissolve in aq. fluids.  Zinc oxide nanomaterials are of particular concern because dissoln. leads to release of the toxic divalent zinc ion.  Although zinc ions have been implicated in ZnO cytotoxicity, direct identification of the chem. form of zinc taken up by cells exposed to ZnO nanoparticles, and its intracellular fate, has not yet been achieved.  We combined high resoln. X-ray spectromicroscopy and high elemental sensitivity X-ray microprobe analyses to det. the fate of ZnO and less sol. iron-doped ZnO nanoparticles following exposure to cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B.  We complemented two-dimensional X-ray imaging methods with at. force microscopy of cell surfaces to distinguish between nanoparticles that were transported inside the cells from those that adhered to the cell exterior.  The data suggest cellular uptake of ZnO nanoparticles is a mechanism of zinc accumulation in cells.  Following uptake, ZnO nanoparticles dissolved completely generating intracellular Zn2+ complexed by mol. ligands.  These results corroborate a model for ZnO nanoparticle toxicity that is based on nanoparticle uptake followed by intracellular dissoln.\n",

      "To investigate the role of particle size on the oxidn., bioavailability, and adverse effects of manufd. Cu nanoparticles (NPs) in soils, we exposed the earthworm Eisenia fetida to a series of concns. of com. produced NPs labeled as 20- to 40-nm or <100-nm Cu in artificial soil media.  Effects on growth, mortality, reprodn., and expression of a variety of genes assocd. with metal homeostasis, general stress, and oxidative stress were measured.  We also used X-ray absorption spectroscopy and scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy to characterize changes in chem. speciation and spatial distribution of the NPs in soil media and earthworm tissues.  Exposure concns. of Cu NPs up to 65 mg kg-1 caused no adverse effects on ecol. relevant endpoints.  Increases in metallothionein expression occurred at concns. exceeding 20 mg kg-1 of Cu NPs and concns. exceeding 10 mg kg-1 of CuSO4.  Based on the relationship of Cu tissue concn. to metallothionein expression level and the spatial distribution and chem. speciation of Cu in the tissues, we conclude that Cu ions and oxidized Cu NPs were taken up by the earthworms.  This study suggests that oxidized Cu NPs may enter food chains from soil but that adverse effects in earthworms are likely to occur only at relatively high concns. (>65 mg Cu kg-1 soil).\n",

      "It is necessary to elucidate cellular internalization and intracellular biotransformation in order to accurately assess the toxicity and fate of nanoparticles after interaction with organisms.  Therefore, this work employed a combination of high resoln. imaging and in situ detection spectroscopic techniques to systematically investigate the intracellular localization, morphol. and chem. speciation of silver in the cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular freshwater green alga, after exposure to AgNPs coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone at a concn. of 2.0 mg/L.  High resoln. secondary ion mass spectrometry and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy together with energy dispersive spectroscopy and selected area electron diffraction collectively confirmed that after 48 h of exposure, AgNPs entered the periplasmic space after cellular internalization into the algal cells.  Silver was also found to coexist with sulfur inside the cytoplasm in both cryst. and amorphous forms, which were further identified as β-Ag2S and silver thiolates with synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy.  In combination, these analyses demonstrated that silver inside algae could be attributed to the uptake and sequestration of Ag+ ion released from AgNPs, which was further sequestrated into cellular compartments.  This study provides solid evidence for particle internalization and biotransformation of AgNPs after interaction with algae.\n",

      "Understanding plant interactions with nanoparticles is of increasing importance for assessing their toxicity and trophic transport.  The primary objective of this study was to assess uptake, biodistribution and toxicity assocd. with exposure of tobacco plants (Nicotiana xanthi) to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).  We employed synchrotron-based X-ray microanal. with X-ray absorption near-edge microspectroscopy and high resoln. electron microscopy to localize AuNPs within plants.  Results from these expts. reveal that AuNPs entered plants through the roots and moved into the vasculature.  Aggregate bodies were also detected within root cell cytoplasm.  Furthermore, AuNP uptake was size selective as 3.5 nm AuNP spheres were detected in plants but 18 nm AuNPs remained agglomerated on the root outer surfaces.  Finally, leaf necrosis was obsd. after 14 days of exposure to 3.5 nm AuNPs.  Overall, results of this work show the potential for AuNPs to enter plants through size-dependent mechanisms, translocate to cells and tissues and cause biotoxicity.\n",

      "While large-scale synchrotron sources provide a highly brilliant monochromatic X-ray beam, these X-ray sources are expensive in terms of installation and maintenance, and require large amounts of space due to the size of storage rings for GeV electrons.  On the other hand, laboratory X-ray tube sources can easily be implemented in laboratories or hospitals with comparatively little cost, but their performance features a lower brilliance and a polychromatic spectrum creates problems with beam hardening artifacts for imaging experiments.  Over the last decade, compact synchrotron sources based on inverse Compton scattering have evolved as one of the most promising types of laboratory-scale X-ray sources: they provide a performance and brilliance that lie in between those of large-scale synchrotron sources and X-ray tube sources, with significantly reduced financial and spatial requirements.  These sources produce X-rays through the collision of relativistic electrons with infrared laser photons.  In this study, an analysis of the performance, such as X-ray flux, source size and spectra, of the first commercially sold compact light source, the Munich Compact Light Source, is presented.\n",

      "Between X-ray tubes and large-scale synchrotron sources, a large gap in performance exists with respect to the monochromaticity and brilliance of the X-ray beam.  However, due to their size and cost, large-scale synchrotrons are not available for more routine applications in small and medium-sized academic or industrial labs.  This gap could be closed by laser-driven compact synchrotron light sources (CLS), which use an IR (IR) laser cavity in combination with a small electron storage ring.  Hard X-rays are produced through the process of inverse Compton scattering upon the intersection of the electron bunch with the focused laser beam.  The produced X-ray beam is intrinsically monochromatic and highly collimated.  This makes a CLS well-suited for applications of more advanced--and more challenging--X-ray imaging approaches, such as X-ray multimodal tomog.  Here we present, to our knowledge, the first results of a first successful demonstration expt. in which a monochromatic X-ray beam from a CLS was used for multimodal, i.e., phase-, dark-field, and attenuation-contrast, X-ray tomog.  We show results from a fluid phantom with different liqs. and a biomedical application example in the form of a multimodal CT scan of a small animal (mouse, ex vivo).  The results highlight particularly that quant. multimodal CT has become feasible with laser-driven CLS, and that the results outperform more conventional approaches.\n",

      "Abstr.: Novel compact x-ray sources based on inverse Compton scattering can generate brilliant hard x-rays in a lab. setting.  Their collimated intense beams with tunable well-defined x-ray energies make them well suited for x-ray spectroscopy techniques, which are typically carried out at large facilities.  Here, we demonstrate a first x-ray absorption spectroscopy proof-of-principle expt. using an inverse Compton x-ray source with a flux of >1010 photons/s in <5% bandwidth.  We measured x-ray absorption near edge structure and extended x-ray absorption fine structure at the silver K-edge (∼25.5 keV) for a series of silver samples.  We propose an energy-dispersive geometry specifically adapted to the x-ray beam properties of inverse Compton x-ray sources together with a fast concn. correction method that corrects sample inhomogeneities very effectively.  The combination of our setup with the inverse Compton source generates x-ray absorption spectra with high energy resoln. in exposure times down to one minute.  Our results unravel the great benefit of inverse Compton scattering sources for x-ray absorption techniques in a lab. environment, esp. in the hard x-ray regime, which allows to probe absorption edges of high Z materials.\n",

      "Mech. ventilation (MV) and supplementation of oxygen-enriched gas, often needed in postnatal resuscitation procedures, are known to be main risk factors for impaired pulmonary development in the preterm and term neonates.  Unfortunately, current imaging modalities lack in sensitivity for the detection of early stage lung injury.  The present study reports a new imaging approach for diagnosis and staging of early lung injury induced by MV and hyperoxia in neonatal mice.  The imaging method is based on the Talbot-Lau x-ray grating interferometry that makes it possible to quantify the x-ray small-angle scattering on the air-tissue interfaces.  This so-called dark-field signal revealed increasing loss of x-ray small-angle scattering when comparing images of neonatal mice undergoing hyperoxia and MV-O2 with animals kept at room air.  The changes in the dark field correlated well with histol. findings and provided superior differentiation than conventional x-ray imaging and lung function testing.  The results suggest that x-ray dark-field radiog. is a sensitive tool for assessing structural changes in the developing lung.  In the future, with further tech. developments x-ray dark-field imaging could be an important tool for earlier diagnosis and sensitive monitoring of lung injury in neonates requiring postnatal oxygen or ventilator therapy.\n",

      "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease with a median life expectancy of 4-5 years after initial diagnosis.  Early diagnosis and accurate monitoring of IPF are limited by a lack of sensitive imaging techniques that are able to visualize early fibrotic changes at the epithelial-mesenchymal interface.  Here, we report a new x-ray imaging approach that directly visualizes the air-tissue interfaces in mice in vivo.  This imaging method is based on the detection of small-angle x-ray scattering that occurs at the air-tissue interfaces in the lung.  Small-angle scattering is detected with a Talbot-Lau interferometer, which provides the so-called x-ray dark-field signal.  Using this imaging modality, we demonstrate-for the first time-the quantification of early pathogenic changes and their correlation with histol. changes, as assessed by stereol. morphometry.  The presented radiog. method is significantly more sensitive in detecting morphol. changes compared with conventional x-ray imaging, and exhibits a significantly lower radiation dose than conventional x-ray CT.  As a result of the improved imaging sensitivity, this new imaging modality could be used in future to reduce the no. of animals required for pulmonary research studies.\n",

      "X-ray chest radiography is an inexpensive and broadly available tool for initial assessment of the lung in clinical routine, but typically lacks diagnostic sensitivity for detection of pulmonary diseases in their early stages.  Recent X-ray dark-field (XDF) imaging studies on mice have shown significant improvements in imaging-based lung diagnostics.  Especially in the case of early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), XDF imaging clearly outperforms conventional radiography.  However, a translation of this technique towards the investigation of larger mammals and finally humans has not yet been achieved.  In this letter, we present the first in-vivo XDF full-field chest radiographs (32 × 35 cm(2)) of a living pig, acquired with clinically compatible parameters (40 s scan time, approx. 80 μSv dose).  For imaging, we developed a novel high-energy XDF system that overcomes the limitations of currently established setups.  Our XDF radiographs yield sufficiently high image quality to enable radiographic evaluation of the lungs.  We consider this a milestone in the bench-to-bedside translation of XDF imaging and expect XDF imaging to become an invaluable tool in clinical practice, both as a general chest X-ray modality and as a dedicated tool for high-risk patients affected by smoking, industrial work and indoor cooking.\n",

      "An x-ray interferometer has been developed that uses two transmission phase gratings to analyze wave front distortions in the hard x-ray range.  The interferometer is insensitive to mech. drift and vibrations, and it is tunable over a wide range of photon energies.  This setup was used for differential phase contrast imaging of low-absorbing test objects.  We obtained micrographs with moire´ fringes of good visibility, which revealed the local phase shift gradient caused by the objects.  A comparison with numerically simulated images indicates that quant. anal. of unknown phase objects is possible.\n",

      "First Talbot interferometry in the hard x-ray region was demonstrated using a pair of transmission gratings made by forming Au stripes on glass plates.  By aligning the gratings on the optical axis of x-rays with a sepn. that caused the Talbot effect by the 1st grating, moire fringes were produced inclining 1 grating slightly against the other around the optical axis.  A phase object placed in front of the 1st grating was detected by moire-fringe bending.  Using the technique of phase-shifting interferometry, the differential phase corresponding to the phase object could also be measured.  Probably x-ray Talbot interferometry is a novel and simple method for phase-sensitive x-ray radiog.\n",

      "X-ray radiog. absorption imaging is an important tool in medical diagnostics and materials science.  However, for biol. tissue samples, polymers or fiber composites, the use of conventional X-ray radiog. is limited due to their weak absorption.  This is resolved at highly brilliant X-ray synchrotron or micro-focus sources by using phase-sensitive imaging methods to improve the contrast.  However, the requirements of the illuminating radiation mean that hard-X-ray phase-sensitive imaging has until now been impractical with more readily available X-ray sources, such as X-ray tubes.  A grating-based differential phase-contrast setup is presented which can be efficiently used to retrieve quant. phase images with conventional X-ray tubes.  The setup consists of three transmission gratings, namely source, phase, and analyzer absorption gratings.  In contrast with existing techniques, the method requires no spatial or temporal coherence, is mech. robust, and can be scaled up to large fields of view.  The method provides all the benefits of contrast-enhanced phase-sensitive imaging, but is also fully compatible with conventional absorption radiog.  It is applicable to X-ray medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing, and to other low-brilliance radiation, such as neutrons or atoms.\n",

      "Imaging with visible light today uses numerous contrast mechanisms, including bright- and dark-field contrast, phase-contrast schemes and confocal and fluorescence-based methods.  X-ray imaging, however, has only recently seen the development of an analogous variety of contrast modalities.  Although x-ray phase-contrast imaging could successfully be implemented at a relatively early stage with several techniques, dark-field imaging, or more generally scattering-based imaging, with hard x-rays and good signal-to-noise ratio, in practice still remains a challenging task even at highly brilliant synchrotron sources.  The authors report a new approach from a grating interferometer that can efficiently yield dark-field scatter images of high quality, even with conventional x-ray tube sources.  Because the image contrast is formed through the mechanism of small-angle scattering, it provides complementary and otherwise inaccessible structural information about the specimen at the micrometer and submicrometer length scale.  The authors' approach is fully compatible with conventional transmission radiog. and a recently developed hard-x-ray phase-contrast imaging scheme.  Applications to x-ray medical imaging, industrial nondestructive testing and security screening are discussed.\n",

      "Disorders of the lungs such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality and the third leading cause of death in the world.  The absence of sensitive diagnostic tests for early disease stages of COPD results in under-diagnosis of this treatable disease in an estd. 60-85% of the patients.  In recent years a grating-based approach to X-ray dark-field contrast imaging has shown to be very sensitive for the detection and quantification of pulmonary emphysema in small animal models.  However, translation of this technique to imaging systems suitable for humans remains challenging and has not yet been reported.  In this manuscript, we present the first X-ray dark-field images of in-situ human lungs in a deceased body, demonstrating the feasibility of X-ray dark-field chest radiog. on a human scale.  Results were correlated with findings of computed tomog. imaging and autopsy.  The performance of the exptl. radiog. setup allows acquisition of multi-contrast chest X-ray images within clin. boundary conditions, including radiation dose.  Upcoming clin. studies will have to demonstrate that this technol. has the potential to improve early diagnosis of COPD and pulmonary diseases in general.\n",

      "Grating-based X-ray dark-field imaging is a novel imaging modality which has been refined during the last decade.  It exploits the wave-like behaviour of X-radiation and can nowadays be implemented with existing X-ray tubes used in clinical applications.  The method is based on the detection of small-angle X-ray scattering, which occurs e.g. at air-tissue-interfaces in the lung or bone-fat interfaces in spongy bone.  In contrast to attenuation-based chest X-ray imaging, the optimal tube voltage for dark-field imaging of the thorax has not yet been examined.  In this work, dark-field scans with tube voltages ranging from 60 to 120 kVp were performed on a deceased human body.  We analyzed the resulting images with respect to subjective and objective image quality, and found that the optimum tube voltage for dark-field thorax imaging at the used setup is at rather low energies of around 60 to 70 kVp.  Furthermore, we found that at these tube voltages, the transmission radiographs still exhibit sufficient image quality to correlate dark-field information.  Therefore, this study may serve as an important guideline for the development of clinical dark-field chest X-ray imaging devices for future routine use.\n",

      "Here, we present a functional assay to detect the repair switch to the alternative PARP1-dependent end joining (PARP1-EJ) pathway and the associated susceptibility to PARPi-mediated radiosensitization in freshly collected tumor samples from prostate cancer (PCa) patients, thereby facilitating the selection of patients who should benefit from combined PARPi plus radiotherapy (RT) treatment.  Our optimized ex-vivo approach sustains tumor slices for up to 15 days under culture conditions that maintain proliferation and oxygenation rates, as measured by EdU incorporation and pimonidazole staining, respectively.  We present a robust system to analyze DSB repair using, for the first time in an ex vivo tumor slice setting, two DSB-markers simultaneously i.e. γH2AX and 53BP1.  A computer-based processing method (i) controls variations in DNA content and slicing on the number of repair foci and (ii) measures the PARPi-mediated enhancement ratio on DSB foci numbers to ensure inter-patient-comparability.  We validated this approach using a PC3 xenograft model with its previously described repair switch to PARP1-EJ.  More importantly, we show that approximately 30% of the analyzed tumor tissue samples collected from PCa patients display a switch to PARP1-EJ, as indicated by the enhanced number of residual γH2AX/53BP1 foci exclusively after PARPi+RT.  Furthermore, normal prostatic tissues show no repair switch to PARP1-EJ, indicating that this repair switch and its associated radiosensitizing effect is tumor-specific.  Collectively, we present here a predictive assay for the switch to PARP1-EJ that enables individualization of anti-cancer treatment using a combination of RT and radiosensitizing anticancer agents such as PARPi in PCa.\n",

      "A review.  Cancer occurs when cells acquire genomic instability and inflammation, produce abnormal levels of epigenetic factors/proteins and tumor suppressors, reprogram the energy metab. and evade immune destruction, leading to the disruption of cell cycle/normal growth.  An early event in carcinogenesis is loss of polarity and detachment from the natural basement membrane, allowing cells to form distinct three-dimensional (3D) structures that interact with each other and with the surrounding microenvironment.  Although valuable information has been accumulated from traditional in vitro studies in which cells are grown on flat and hard plastic surfaces (2D culture), this culture condition does not reflect the essential features of tumor tissues.  Further, fundamental understanding of cancer metastasis cannot be obtained readily from 2D studies because they lack the complex and dynamic cell-cell communications and cell-matrix interactions that occur during cancer metastasis.  These shortcomings, along with lack of spatial depth and cell connectivity, limit the applicability of 2D cultures to accurate testing of pharmacol. active compds., free or sequestered in nanoparticles.  To recapitulate features of native tumor microenvironments, various biomimetic 3D tumor models have been developed to incorporate cancer and stromal cells, relevant matrix components, and biochem. and biophys. cues, into one spatially and temporally integrated system.  In this article, we review recent advances in creating 3D tumor models employing tissue engineering principles.  We then evaluate the utilities of these novel models for the testing of anticancer drugs and their delivery systems.  We highlight the profound differences in responses from 3D in vitro tumors and conventional monolayer cultures.  Overall, strategic integration of biol. principles and engineering approaches will both improve understanding of tumor progression and invasion and support discovery of more personalized first line treatments for cancer patients.\n",

      "The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of bioreactor-based culture systems as alternatives to conventional two- and three-dimensional counterparts.  The role, challenges, and future aspirations of bioreactors in the musculoskeletal field (e.g., cartilage, intervertebral disc, tendon, and bone) are discussed.  Bioreactors, by recapitulating physiological processes, can be used effectively as part of the initial in vitro screening, reducing that way the number of animal required for preclinical assessment, complying with the 3R principles and, in most cases, allowing working with human tissues.  The clinical significance of bioreactors is that, by providing more physiologically relevant conditions to customarily used two- and three-dimensional cultures, they hold the potential to provide a testing platform that is more predictable of a whole tissue response, thereby facilitating the screening of treatments before the initiation of clinical trials. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

      "BACKGROUND & AIMS:  We conducted a systematic review to determine changes in the worldwide incidence and prevalence of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in different regions and with time.  METHODS:  We performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE (1950-2010; 8103 citations) and EMBASE (1980-2010; 4975 citations) to identify studies that were population based, included data that could be used to calculate incidence and prevalence, and reported separate data on UC and/or CD in full manuscripts (n = 260).  We evaluated data from 167 studies from Europe (1930-2008), 52 studies from Asia and the Middle East (1950-2008), and 27 studies from North America (1920-2004).  Maps were used to present worldwide differences in the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); time trends were determined using joinpoint regression.  RESULTS:  The highest annual incidence of UC was 24.3 per 100,000 person-years in Europe, 6.3 per 100,000 person-years in Asia and the Middle East, and 19.2 per 100,000 person-years in North America.  The highest annual incidence of CD was 12.7 per 100,000 person-years in Europe, 5.0 person-years in Asia and the Middle East, and 20.2 per 100,000 person-years in North America.  The highest reported prevalence values for IBD were in Europe (UC, 505 per 100,000 persons; CD, 322 per 100,000 persons) and North America (UC, 249 per 100,000 persons; CD, 319 per 100,000 persons).  In time-trend analyses, 75% of CD studies and 60% of UC studies had an increasing incidence of statistical significance (P < .05).  CONCLUSIONS:  Although there are few epidemiologic data from developing countries, the incidence and prevalence of IBD are increasing with time and in different regions around the world, indicating its emergence as a global disease.\n",

      "The cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) was thought to have a central role in T cell-mediated responses in inflammation for more than a decade after it was first identified.  Discovery of the cytokine IL-23, which shares a common p40 subunit with IL-12, prompted efforts to clarify the relative contribution of these two cytokines in immune regulation.  Ustekinumab, a therapeutic agent targeting both cytokines, was recently approved to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and related agents are in clin. testing for a variety of inflammatory disorders.  Here we discuss the therapeutic rationale for targeting these cytokines, the unintended consequences for host defense and tumor surveillance and potential ways in which these therapies can be applied to treat addnl. immune disorders.\n",

      "Genome-wide assocn. studies have identified loci underlying human diseases, but the causal nucleotide changes and mechanisms remain largely unknown.  Here the authors developed a fine-mapping algorithm to identify candidate causal variants for 21 autoimmune diseases from genotyping data.  The authors integrated these predictions with transcription and cis-regulatory element annotations, derived by mapping RNA and chromatin in primary immune cells, including resting and stimulated CD4+ T-cell subsets, regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes.  The authors find that ∼90% of causal variants are non-coding, with ∼60% mapping to immune-cell enhancers, many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer-assocd. RNA upon immune stimulation.  Causal variants tend to occur near binding sites for master regulators of immune differentiation and stimulus-dependent gene activation, but only 10-20% directly alter recognizable transcription factor binding motifs.  Rather, most non-coding risk variants, including those that alter gene expression, affect non-canonical sequence determinants not well-explained by current gene regulatory models.\n",

      "Summary: T helper 17 (Th17) cells are important for host defense against extracellular microorganisms.  However, they are also implicated in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, and as such need to be tightly regulated.  The mechanisms that directly control committed pathogenic Th17 cells in vivo remain unclear.  We showed here that IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells expressed interleukin-10 receptor α (IL-10Rα) in vivo.  Importantly, T cell-specific blockade of IL-10 signaling led to a selective increase of IL-17A+IFN-γ- (Th17) and IL-17A+IFN-γ+ (Th17+Th1) CD4+ T cells during intestinal inflammation in the small intestine.  CD4+Foxp3- IL-10-producing (Tr1) cells and CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory (Treg) cells were able to control Th17 and Th17+Th1 cells in an IL-10-dependent manner in vivo.  Lastly, IL-10 treatment of mice with established colitis decreased Th17 and Th17+Th1 cell frequencies via direct signaling in T cells.

      "Summary: Effector CD4+ T cell subsets, whose differentiation is facilitated by distinct cytokine cues, amplify the corresponding type of inflammatory response.  Regulatory T (Treg) cells integrate environmental cues to suppress particular types of inflammation.  In this regard, STAT3, a transcription factor essential for T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation, is necessary for Treg cell-mediated control of Th17 cell responses.  Here, we showed that anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10), and not proinflammatory IL-6 and IL-23 cytokine signaling, endowed Treg cells with the ability to suppress pathogenic Th17 cell responses.  Ablation of the IL-10 receptor in Treg cells resulted in selective dysregulation of Th17 cell responses and colitis similar to that obsd. in mice harboring STAT3-deficient Treg cells.  Thus, Treg cells limit Th17 cell inflammation by serving as principal amplifiers of neg. regulatory circuits operating in immune effector cells.\n",

      "The mol. cause of inflammatory bowel disease is largely unknown.  We performed genetic-linkage anal. and candidate-gene sequencing on samples from two unrelated consanguineous families with children who were affected by early-onset inflammatory bowel disease.  We screened six addnl. patients with early-onset colitis for mutations in two candidate genes and carried out functional assays in patients' peripheral-blood mononuclear cells.  We performed an allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in one patient.  In four of nine patients with early-onset colitis, we identified three distinct homozygous mutations in genes IL10RA and IL10B, encoding the IL10R1 and IL10R2 proteins, resp., which form a heterotetramer to make up the interleukin-10 receptor.  The mutations abrogate interleukin-10-induced signaling, as shown by deficient STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation on stimulation with interleukin-10.  Consistent with this observation was the increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor a and other proinflammatory cytokines from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from patients who were deficient in IL10R subunit proteins, suggesting that interleukin-10-dependent \"neg. feedback\" regulation is disrupted in these cells.  The allogeneic stem-cell transplantation performed in one patient was successful.  Mutations in genes encoding the IL10R subunit proteins were found in patients with early-onset enterocolitis, involving hyperinflammatory immune responses in the intestine.  Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation resulted in disease remission in one patient.\n",

      "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a heterogeneous group of gastrointestinal disorders, where commensal gut flora provokes an either (a) insufficient or (b) uncontrolled immune response.  This results either in a lack of or in excessive inflammation mainly manifesting as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.  IBD commonly presents in adolescence and adulthood and often follows a chronic relapsing course.  Genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to the failure of gut immune homeostasis.  Genome-wide assocn. studies have identified over 160 susceptibility loci assocd. with IBD, including polymorphisms in interleukin-10 (IL-10).  The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 dampens intestinal inflammation and is therefore a good candidate gene for IBD.  Polymorphisms in the IL-10 receptor are also assocd. with ulcerative colitis presenting in early childhood.  Moreover, severe infantile enterocolitis resembling Crohn's disease, caused by loss-of-function mutations in IL-10 and IL-10 receptor, is characterized by a very early onset (usually within the first 3 mo of life), unresponsiveness to std. treatment including immunosuppressive therapy, and severe perianal disease with abscesses and fistulas.  In these patients, inflammation and polymorphic infiltrates are mainly confined to the colon with very little involvement of the small intestine.  Ulceration and granulomas, bloody diarrhea and failure to thrive also occur.  Furthermore, patients may suffer from recurrent fever and respiratory infections.  Individuals with IL-10 receptor mutations also experience cutaneous folliculitis and arthritis.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the only curative therapy.\n",

      "Achieving effective treatment of deep-seated tumors is a major challenge for traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to difficulties in delivering light into the subsurface.  Thanks to their great tissue penetration, X-rays hold the potential to become an ideal excitation source for activating photosensitizers (PS) that accumulate in deep tumor tissue.  Recently, a wide variety of nanoparticles have been developed for this purpose.  The nanoparticles are designed as carriers for loading various kinds of PSs and can facilitate the activation process by transferring energy harvested from X-ray irradn. to the loaded PS.  In this review, we focus on recent developments of nanoscintillators with high energy transfer efficiency, their rational designs, as well as potential applications in next-generation PDT.  Treatment of deep-seated tumors by using radioisotopes as an internal light source will also be discussed.\n",

      "A review.  Radiotherapy is one of the major therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.  In the past decade, there has been growing interest in using high Z (at. no.) elements (materials) as radiosensitizers.  New strategies in nanomedicine could help to improve cancer diagnosis and therapy at cellular and mol. levels.  Metal-based nanoparticles usually exhibit chem. inertness in cellular and subcellular systems and may play a role in radiosensitization and synergistic cell-killing effects for radiation therapy.  This review summarizes the efficacy of metal-based NanoEnhancers against cancers in both in vitro and in vivo systems for a range of ionizing radiations including gamma-rays, X-rays, and charged particles.  The potential of translating preclin. studies on metal-based nanoparticles-enhanced radiation therapy into clin. practice is also discussed using examples of several metal-based NanoEnhancers (such as CYT-6091, AGuIX, and NBTXR3).  Also, a few general examples of theranostic multimetallic nanocomposites are presented, and the related biol. mechanisms are discussed.\n",

      "Nanoparticles (NPs) contg. high at. no. (high-Z) materials have been shown to enhance the radiobiol. effectiveness of ionizing radiation.  This effect is often attributed to an enhancement of the absorbed dose in the vicinity of the NPs, based on Monte Carlo simulations that show a significant local enhancement of the energy deposition on the microscopic scale.  The results of such simulations may be significantly biased and lead to a severe overestimation of the dose enhancement if the condition of secondary particle equil. is not met in the simulation setup.  This current work shows an approach to est. a 'realistic' dose enhancement from the results of such biased simulations which is based on published photon interaction data and provides a way for correcting biased results.\n",

      "Gold nanoparticle (GNP) radio-enhancement is a promising technique to increase the dose deposition in a tumor while sparing neighboring healthy tissue.  Previous exptl. studies showed effects on cell survival and tumor control for keV x-rays but surprisingly also for MV-photons, proton and carbon-ion beams.  In a systematic study, we use the Monte Carlo simulation tool TOPAS-nBio to model the GNP radio-enhancement within a cell as a function of GNP concn., size and clustering for a wide range of energies for photons, protons and, for the first time, carbon-ions.  Moreover, we include water radiolysis, which has been recognized as a major pathway of GNP mediated radio-enhancement.  At a GNP concn. of 0.5% and a GNP diam. of 10 nm, the dose enhancement ratio was highest for 50 keV x-rays (1.36) and decreased in the orthovoltage (1.04 at 250 keV) and megavoltage range (1.01 at 1 MeV).  The dose enhancement linearly increased with GNP concn. and decreased with GNP size and degree of clustering for all radiation modalities.  While the highest phys. dose enhancement at 5% concns. was only 1.003 for 10 MeV protons and 1.004 for 100 MeV carbon-ions, we find the no. of hydroxyl (•OH) altered by 23% and 3% after 1μs at low, clin.-relevant concns.  For the same concn. and proton-impact, the G-value is most sensitive to the nanoparticle size with 46 times more radical interactions at GNPs for 2 nm than for 50 nm GNP diam. within 1μs.  Nanoparticle clustering was found to decrease the no. of interactions at GNPs, e.g. for a cluster of 25 GNPs by a factor of 3.4.  The changes in G-value correlate to the av. distance between the chem. species and the GNPs.  While the radiochem. of GNP-loaded water has yet to be fully understood, this work offers a first relative quantification of radiolysis products for a broad parameter-set.\n",

      "The radiosensitizing effect of 5-250 nm diam. Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) in water was investigated under irradiations of diagnostic X-ray and UV light.  Enhanced generations of hydroxyl radical (OH) and superoxide anion (O-2) were confirmed from their dependencies on the absorbed energy, ethanol concn. and AuNPs' concn.  Two kinds of fluorescent probes revealed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate under X-ray irradn. was enhanced by factors of 1.46 for OH and 7.68 for O-2.  Photo- and Auger electron charge transfer is possibly relevant to generation of O-2 near the particle surface, whereas fluorescent X-rays are involved in generation of OH in the secondary water radiolysis.  Smaller diam. AuNPs with larger surface area showed a greater yield of ROS.  An inverse proportion of ROS generation to the AuNPs' diam. suggests a catalytic function of AuNPs' surface for enhanced ROS generation.\n",

      "The abs. yield of hydroxyl radicals per unit of deposited X-ray energy is detd. for the first time for irradiated aq. solns. contg. metal nanoparticles based on a \"ref.\" protocol.  Measurements are made as a function of dose rate and nanoparticle concn.  Possible mechanisms for hydroxyl radical prodn. are considered in turn: energy deposition in the nanoparticles followed by its transport into the surrounding environment is unable to account for obsd. yield whereas energy deposition in the water followed by a catalytic-like reaction at the water-nanoparticle interface can account for the total yield and its dependence on dose rate and nanoparticle concn.  This finding is important because current models used to account for nanoparticle enhancement to radiobiol. damage only consider the primary interaction with the nanoparticle, not with the surrounding media.  Nothing about the new mechanism appears to be specific to gold, the main requirements being the formation of a structured water layer in the vicinity of the nanoparticle possibly through the interaction of its charge and the water dipoles.  The massive hydroxyl radical prodn. is relevant to a no. of application fields, particularly nanomedicine since the hydroxyl radical is responsible for the majority of radiation-induced DNA damage.\n",

      "The Coulomb nanoradiator (CNR) effect produces the dose enhancement effects from high-Z nanoparticles under irradn. with a high-energy ion beam.  To gain insight into the radiation dose and biol. significance of the CNR effect, the enhancement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) prodn. from iron oxide or gold NPs (IONs or AuNPs, resp.) in water was investigated using traversing proton beams.  The dependence of nanoradiator-enhanced ROS prodn. on the at. Z value and proton energy was investigated.  Two biol. important ROS species were measured using fluorescent probes specific to •OH or in a series of water phantoms contg. either AuNPs or IONs under irradn. with a 45- or 100-MeV proton beam.  The enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and superoxide anions () was detd. to be caused by the dependence on the NP concn. and proton energy.  The proton-induced Au or iron oxide nanoradiators exhibited different ROS enhancement rates depending on the proton energy, suggesting that the CNR radiation varied.  The curve of the superoxide anion prodn. from the Au-nanoradiator showed strong non-linearity, unlike the linear behavior obsd. for hydroxyl radical prodn. and the X-ray photoelec. nanoradiator.  In addn., the 45-MeV proton-induced Au nanoradiator exhibited an ROS enhancement ratio of 8.54/1.50 ( / •OH), similar to that of the 100-KeV X-ray photoelec. Au nanoradiator (7.68/1.46).  The ROS-based detection of the CNR effect revealed its dependence on the proton beam energy, dose and at. Z value and provided insight into the low-linear energy transfer (LET) CNR radiation, suggesting that these factors may influence the therapeutic efficacy via chem. reactivities, transport behaviors, and intracellular oxidative stress.\n",

      "There is a fundamental interest in studying photoinduced dynamics in nanoparticles and nanostructures as it provides insight into their mech. and thermal properties out of equil. and during phase transitions.  Nanoparticles can display significantly different properties from the bulk, which is due to the interplay between their size, morphol., crystallinity, defect concn., and surface properties.  Particularly interesting scenarios arise when nanoparticles undergo phase transitions, such as melting induced by an optical laser.  Current theor. evidence suggests that nanoparticles can undergo reversible nonhomogenous melting with the formation of a core-shell structure consisting of a liq. outer layer.  To date, studies from ensembles of nanoparticles have tentatively suggested that such mechanisms are present.  Here we demonstrate imaging transient melting and softening of the acoustic phonon modes of an individual gold nanocrystal, using an X-ray free electron laser.  The results demonstrate that the transient melting is reversible and nonhomogenous, consistent with a core-shell model of melting.  The results have implications for understanding transient processes in nanoparticles and detg. their elastic properties as they undergo phase transitions.\n",

      "Sample damage by X-rays and other radiation limits the resoln. of structural studies on non-repetitive and non-reproducible structures such as individual biomols. or cells.  Cooling can slow sample deterioration, but cannot eliminate damage-induced sample movement during the time needed for conventional measurements.  Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per Å2 with X-rays of 12keV energy or 1Å wavelength) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times.  Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein mols. and small assemblies.  Estns. of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that expts. using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample.  We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural detns. with X-rays.\n",

      "A review.  The development and application of the free-electron X-ray laser (XFEL) to structure and dynamics in biol. since its inception in 2009 are reviewed.  The research opportunities which result from the ability to outrun most radiation-damage effects are outlined, and some grand challenges are suggested.  By avoiding the need to cool samples to minimize damage, the XFEL has permitted at. resoln. imaging of mol. processes on the 100 fs timescale under near-physiol. conditions and in the correct thermal bath in which mol. machines operate.  Radiation damage, comparisons of XFEL and synchrotron work, single-particle diffraction, fast soln. scattering, pump-probe studies on photosensitive proteins, mix-and-inject expts., caged mols., pH jump and other reaction-initiation methods, and the study of mol. machines are all discussed.  Sample-delivery methods and data-anal. algorithms for the various modes, from serial femtosecond crystallog. to fast soln. scattering, fluctuation X-ray scattering, mixing jet expts. and single-particle diffraction, are also reviewed.\n",

      "A review.  Coherent X-ray diffractive imaging (CXDI) is a new imaging technique that offers the potential to image non-cryst. materials to sub-nanometer resolns.  Here we review the progress in CXDI of biol. samples at both synchrotron and free electron laser (FEL) sources.  We outline the exptl. design of a CXDI expt. and summarize the iterative phase retrieval techniques that are used to produce images from the measured diffraction patterns.  We describe a selection of key expts. performed in bio-imaging with CXDI from synchrotron sources, and we discuss the proof-of-principle expts. performed at FLASH at DESY in Hamburg.  Finally, we show through simulation that for realistic parameters of hard X-ray FELs a resoln. of a few nanometers may be achieved for individual biol. objects imaged with single pulses of FEL radiation.  Furthermore, we revise how this resoln. may be improved to the sub-nanometer range if we image multiple copies of samples with a reproducible structure.\n",

      "There exists a conspicuous gap of knowledge about the organization of life at mesoscopic levels.  Ultra-fast coherent diffractive imaging with X-ray free-electron lasers can probe structures at the relevant length scales and may reach sub-nanometer resoln. on micron-sized living cells.  Here we show that we can introduce a beam of aerosolised cyanobacteria into the focus of the Linac Coherent Light Source and record diffraction patterns from individual living cells at very low noise levels and at high hit ratios.  We obtain two-dimensional projection images directly from the diffraction patterns, and present the results as synthetic X-ray Nomarski images calcd. from the complex-valued reconstructions.  We further demonstrate that it is possible to record diffraction data to nanometer resoln. on live cells with X-ray lasers.  Extension to sub-nanometer resoln. is within reach, although improvements in pulse parameters and X-ray area detectors will be necessary to unlock this potential.\n",

      "The authors overcome two of the most daunting challenges in single-particle diffractive imaging: collecting many high-quality diffraction patterns on a small amt. of sample and sepg. components from mixed samples.  The authors demonstrate this on carboxysomes, which are polyhedral cell organelles that vary in size and facilitate up to 40% of Earth's carbon fixation.  A new aerosol sample-injector allowed the authors to record 70,000 low-noise diffraction patterns in 12 min with the Linac Coherent Light Source running at 120 Hz.  The authors sep. different structures directly from the diffraction data and show that the size distribution is preserved during sample delivery.  The authors automate phase retrieval and avoid reconstruction artifacts caused by missing modes.  The authors attain the highest-resoln. reconstructions on the smallest single biol. objects imaged with an x-ray laser to date.  These advances lay the foundations for accurate, high-throughput structure detn. by flash-diffractive imaging and offer a means to study structure and structural heterogeneity in biol. and elsewhere.\n",

      "X-ray lasers offer new capabilities in understanding the structure of biol. systems, complex materials and matter under extreme conditions.  Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromol., a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma.  The continuous diffraction pattern of non-cryst. objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval.  Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-cryst. biol. sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source.  Calcns. indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000 K after the pulse had left the sample.  The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resoln. in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage.  The reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement of dense material inside the virion.  We expect that significantly higher resolns. will be achieved in such expts. with shorter and brighter photon pulses focused to a smaller area.  The resoln. in such expts. can be further extended for samples available in multiple identical copies.\n",

      "X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) open the possibility of obtaining diffraction information from a single biol. macromol.  This is because XFELs can generate extremely intense x-ray pulses that are so short that diffraction data can be collected before the sample is destroyed.  By collecting a sufficient no. of single-particle diffraction patterns, the three-dimensional electron d. of a mol. can be reconstructed ab initio.  The quality of the reconstruction depends largely on the no. of patterns collected at the expt.  This paper provides an est. of the no. of diffraction patterns required to reconstruct the electron d. at a targeted spatial resoln.  This est. is verified by simulations for realistic x-ray fluences, repetition rates, and exptl. conditions available at modern XFELs.  Employing the bacterial phytochrome as a model system, we demonstrate that sub-nanometer resoln. is within reach.  (c) 2020 American Institute of Physics.\n",

      "The emergence of femtosecond diffractive imaging with X-ray lasers has enabled pioneering structural studies of isolated particles, such as viruses, at nanometer length scales.  However, the issue of missing low frequency data significantly limits the potential of X-ray lasers to reveal sub-nanometer details of micrometer-sized samples.  We have developed a new technique of dark-field coherent diffractive imaging to simultaneously overcome the missing data issue and enable us to harness the unique contrast mechanisms available in dark-field microscopy.  Images of airborne particulate matter (soot) up to two microns in length were obtained using single-shot diffraction patterns obtained at the Linac Coherent Light Source, four times the size of objects previously imaged in similar expts.  This technique opens the door to femtosecond diffractive imaging of a wide range of micrometer-sized materials that exhibit irreproducible complexity down to the nanoscale, including airborne particulate matter, small cells, bacteria and gold-labeled biol. samples.\n",

Here we report the crystn. and x-ray structure detn. of a p-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA)-protected gold nanoparticle, which comprises 102 gold atoms and 44 p-MBAs.  The central gold atoms are packed in a Marks decahedron, surrounded by addnl. layers of gold atoms in unanticipated geometries.  The p-MBAs interact not only with the gold but also with one another, forming a rigid surface layer.  The particles are chiral, with the two enantiomers alternating in the crystal lattice.

      "A review.  Phytochromes are environmental sensors, historically thought of as red/far-red photoreceptors in plants.  Their photoperception occurs through a covalently linked tetrapyrrole chromophore, which undergoes a light-dependent conformational change propagated through the protein to a variable output domain.  The phytochrome compn. is modular, typically consisting of a PAS-GAF-PHY architecture for the N-terminal photosensory core.  A collection of three-dimensional structures has uncovered key features, including an unusual figure-of-eight knot, an extension reaching from the PHY domain to the chromophore-binding GAF domain, and a centrally located, long αα-helix hypothesized to be crucial for intramol. signaling.  Continuing identification of phytochromes in microbial systems has expanded the assigned sensory abilities of this family out of the red and into the yellow, green, blue, and violet portions of the spectrum.  Furthermore, phytochromes acting not as photoreceptors but as redox sensors have been recognized.  In addn., architectures other than PAS-GAF-PHY are known, thus revealing phytochromes to be a varied group of sensory receptors evolved to utilize their modular design to perceive a signal and respond accordingly.  This review focuses on the structures of bacterial phytochromes and implications for signal transmission.  We also discuss the small but growing set of bacterial phytochromes for which a physiol. function has been ascertained.\n",

      "Phytochromes are photochromic photoreceptors responsible for a myriad of red/far-red light-dependent processes in plants and microorganisms.  Interconversion is initially driven by photoreversible isomerization of bilin, but how this alteration directs the photostate-dependent changes within the protein to actuate signaling is poorly understood.  Here, we describe the structure of the Deinococcus phytochrome photosensory module in its near complete far-red light-absorbing Pfr state.  In addn. to confirming the 180° rotation of the D-pyrrole ring, the dimeric structure clearly identifies downstream rearrangements that trigger large-scale conformational differences between the dark-adapted and photoactivated states.  Mutational analyses verified the importance of residues surrounding the bilin in Pfr stabilization, and protease sensitivity assays corroborated photostate alterations that propagate along the dimeric interface.  Collectively, these data support a cooperative \"toggle\" model for phytochrome photoconversion and advance our understanding of the allosteric connection between the photosensory and output modules.\n",

      "Phytochromes (PHYs) are photoreceptor proteins first discovered in plants, where they control a variety of photomorphogenesis events.  PHYs as photochromic proteins can reversibly switch between two distinct states: a red light (Pr) and a far-red light (Pfr) absorbing form.  The discovery of Bacteriophytochromes (BphPs) in nonphotosynthetic bacteria has opened new frontiers in our understanding of the mechanisms by which these natural photoswitches can control single cell development, although the role of BphPs in vivo remains largely unknown.  BphPs are dimeric proteins that consist of a photosensory core module (PCM) and an enzymic domain, often a histidine kinase.  The PCM is composed of three domains (PAS, GAF, and PHY).  It holds a covalently bound open-chain tetrapyrrole (biliverdin, BV) chromophore.  Upon absorption of light, the double bond between BV rings C and D isomerizes and reversibly switches the protein between Pr and Pfr states.  We report crystal structures of the wild-type and mutant (His275Thr) forms of the canonical BphP from the nonphotosynthetic myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca (SaBphP2) in the Pr state.  Structures were detd. at 1.65 Å and 2.2 Å (resp.), the highest resoln. of any PCM construct to date.  We also report the room temp. wild-type structure of the same protein detd. at 2.1 Å at the SPring-8 Angstrom Compact free electron LAser (SACLA), Japan.  Our results not only highlight and confirm important amino acids near the chromophore that play a role in Pr-Pfr photoconversion but also describe the signal transduction into the PHY domain which moves across tens of angstroms after the light stimulus.

      "Sensory proteins must relay structural signals from the sensory site over large distances to regulatory output domains.  Phytochromes are a major family of red-light-sensing kinases that control diverse cellular functions in plants, bacteria and fungi.  Bacterial phytochromes consist of a photosensory core and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain.  Structures of photosensory cores are reported in the resting state and conformational responses to light activation have been proposed in the vicinity of the chromophore.  However, the structure of the signaling state and the mechanism of downstream signal relay through the photosensory core remain elusive.  Here we report crystal and soln. structures of the resting and activated states of the photosensory core of the bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans.  The structures show an open and closed form of the dimeric protein for the activated and resting states, resp.  This nanometer-scale rearrangement is controlled by refolding of an evolutionarily conserved 'tongue', which is in contact with the chromophore.  The findings reveal an unusual mechanism in which at.-scale conformational changes around the chromophore are first amplified into an angstrom-scale distance change in the tongue, and further grow into a nanometer-scale conformational signal.  The structural mechanism is a blueprint for understanding how phytochromes connect to the cellular signaling network.\n",

      "The routine at. resoln. structure detn. of single particles is expected to have profound implications for probing structure-function relationships in systems ranging from energy-storage materials to biol. mols.  Extremely bright ultrashort-pulse X-ray sources - X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) - provide X-rays that can be used to probe ensembles of nearly identical nanoscale particles.  When combined with coherent diffractive imaging, these objects can be imaged; however, as the resoln. of the images approaches the at. scale, the measured data are increasingly difficult to obtain and, during an X-ray pulse, the no. of photons incident on the 2D detector is much smaller than the no. of pixels.  This latter concern, the signal 'sparsity', materially impedes the application of the method.  An exptl. analog using a conventional X-ray source is demonstrated and yields signal levels comparable with those expected from single biomols. illuminated by focused XFEL pulses.  The analog expt. provides an invaluable cross check on the fidelity of the reconstructed data that is not available during XFEL expts.  Using these exptl. data, it is established that a sparsity of order 1.3 × 10-3 photons per pixel per frame can be overcome, lending vital insight to the soln. of the at. resoln. XFEL single-particle imaging problem by exptl. demonstrating 3D coherent diffractive imaging from photon-sparse random projections.\n",

      "X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) now routinely produce millijoule level pulses of x-ray photons with tens of femtoseconds duration.  Such x-ray intensities gave rise to the idea that weakly scattering particles-perhaps single biomols. or viruses-could be investigated free of radiation damage.  Here, we examine elements from the past decade of so-called single particle imaging with hard XFELs.  We look at the progress made to date and identify some future possible directions for the field.  In particular, we summarize the presently achieved resolns. as well as identifying the bottlenecks and enabling technologies to future resoln. improvement, which in turn enables application to samples of scientific interest.

      "1.  A phase I trial of a cisplatin-albumin complex for the treatment of end-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is reported.  The complex was prepared by overnight incubation of cisplatin with human albumin at 37 degrees C.  This resulted in more than 98% of the drug being bound to protein at the start of treatment.  The patients were either unable to continue with or had refused conventional therapy with cisplatin. 2.  The trial began at a dose of 100 mg cisplatin m-2 and was increased in 25 mg m-2 increments to 650 mg m-2.  Despite the absence of the customary protective measures of pre-hydration and anti-emetic treatment no serious toxicity was encountered. 3.  Unbound plasma platinum concentrations were lower than after conventional cisplatin treatment but total plasma platinum and tumour platinum concentrations were much higher.  Urinary excretion of platinum was low and the incidence of nephrotoxicity was greatly diminished.  Two responses were seen (one complete and one partial) in 38 patients treated and the median survival time was 109 days, compared with 151 days for patients treated conventionally with cisplatin and 56 days for untreated patients. 4.  The complex is not as effective as conventional cisplatin therapy but is much less toxic, offers improved quality of life during treatment and may prove to be of benefit in patients who could not otherwise be treated.\n",

      "A review.  Solvent-based delivery vehicles for chemotherapy agents have been instrumental in providing a means for hydrophobic agents to be administered i.v.  These solvents, however, have been assocd. with serious and dose-limiting toxicities.  Solvent-based formulations of taxanes, a highly active class of cytotoxic agents, are assocd. with hypersensitivity reactions, neutropenia, and neuropathy.  Nanoparticle technol. utilizing the human protein albumin exploits natural pathways to selectively deliver larger amts. of drug to tumors while avoiding some of the toxicities of solvent-based formulations. 130-nM albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane) was recently approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed combination therapy.  In a randomized, phase III study in metastatic breast cancer, nab-paclitaxel had improved efficacy and safety compared with conventional, solvent-based paclitaxel.  Preliminary data also suggest roles for nab-paclitaxel as a single agent and in combination therapy for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer as well as in other solid tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and malignant melanoma.  The nab technol. promises to have broad utility in cancer therapy, and clin. trials are underway using nab formulations of other water-insol. anticancer agents such as docetaxel and rapamycin.\n",

      "A review.  Doxil, the first FDA-approved nano-drug (1995), is based on three unrelated principles: (i) prolonged drug circulation time and avoidance of the RES due to the use of PEGylated nano-liposomes; (ii) high and stable remote loading of doxorubicin driven by a transmembrane ammonium sulfate gradient, which also allows for drug release at the tumor; and (iii) having the liposome lipid bilayer in a liq. ordered phase composed of the high-Tm (53 °C) phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol.  Due to the EPR effect, Doxil is passively targeted to tumors and its doxorubicin is released and becomes available to tumor cells by as yet unknown means.  This review summarizes historical and scientific perspectives of Doxil development and lessons learned from its development and 20 years of its use.  It demonstrates the obligatory need for applying an understanding of the cross talk between physicochem., nano-technol., and biol. principles.  However, in spite of the large reward, ~ 2 years after Doxil-related patents expired, there is still no FDA-approved generic Doxil available.\n",

      "A review.  A medicine consists of 2 fundamental parts: the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the excipient.  Most, if not all, medicines could not be made without the use of excipients.  In the early times, the safety of excipients was overlooked and no specific safety tests were generally conducted.  This fact has been changed over times and is currently being recognized that the excipient's toxicity is not negligible, because its direct interaction with the active pharmaceutical ingredient or between other excipients may occur, leading to a potential change in the relationship between effectiveness and toxicity.  This review is intended to address the general status of the pharmaceutical excipients and to describe the safety assessment.  As a summary, this review suggests the interest of simplifying the formulations as much as possible and the interest of reducing the no. of excipients necessary to strictly meet the required functions.  The risk/benefit ratio of an excipient should be always evaluated on the basis of not only its prodn. and quality but also of its safety.  Further research according to Good Manufg. Practices, Guiding Principles in Toxicol. Assessment, Good Lab. Practices, and Good Distribution Practices requirements are needed and are fundamental for health safety, contributing to a comprehensive picture of this matter.\n",

      "A review.  Nanotechnol. will affect our lives tremendously over the next decade in very different fields, including medicine and pharmacy.  Transfer of materials into the nanodimension changes their phys. properties which were used in pharmaceutics to develop a new innovative formulation principle for poorly sol. drugs: the drug nanocrystals.  The drug nanocrystals do not belong to the future; the first products are already on the market.  The industrially relevant prodn. technologies, pearl milling and high pressure homogenization, are reviewed.  The physics behind the drug nanocrystals and changes of their phys. properties are discussed.  The marketed products are presented and the special phys. effects of nanocrystals explained which are utilized in each market product.  Examples of products in the development pipelines (clin. phases) are presented and the benefits for in vivo administration of drug nanocrystals are summarized in an overview.\n",

      "A review.  In soln., nanoparticles may be conceptually compartmentalized into cores and engineered surface coatings.  Recent advances allow for simple and accurate characterization of nanoparticle cores and surface shells.  After introduction into complex biol. environment, adsorption of biol. mols. to the nanoparticle surface as well as a loss of original surface components occur.  Thus, colloidal nanoparticles in the context of biol. environment are hybrid materials with complex structure, which may result in different chem., phys., and biol. outcomes as compared to the original engineered nanoparticles.  In this perspective, the authors will discuss building up an engineered inorg. nanoparticle from its inside core to its outside surface, and following its degrdn. in biol. environment from its outside to its inside.  This will involve the way to synthesize selected inorg. nanoparticles.  Then, the authors will discuss the environmental changes upon exposure of these nanoparticles to biol. media and their uptake by cells.  Next, the intracellular fate of nanoparticles and their degrdn. will be discussed.  Based on the examples the need to see nanoparticles in the context of biol. environment as dynamic hybrid materials will be highlighted.\n",

      "A review.  What happens to inorg. nanoparticles (NPs), such as plasmonic gold or silver, superparamagnetic iron oxide, or fluorescent quantum dot NPs after they have been administrated to a living being.  This review discusses the integrity, biodistribution, and fate of NPs after in vivo administration.  The hybrid nature of the NPs is described, conceptually divided into the inorg. core, the engineered surface coating comprising of the ligand shell and optionally also bio-conjugates, and the corona of adsorbed biol. mols.  Empirical evidence shows that all of these three compds. may degrade individually in vivo and can drastically modify the life cycle and biodistribution of the whole heterostructure.  Thus, the NPs may be decompd. into different parts, whose biodistribution and fate would need to be analyzed individually.  Multiple labeling and quantification strategies for such a purpose will be discussed.  All reviewed data indicate that NPs in vivo should no longer be considered as homogeneous entities, but should be seen as inorg./org./biol. nano-hybrids with complex and intricately linked distribution and degrdn. pathways.\n",

      "Targeted delivery approaches for cancer therapeutics have shown a steep rise over the past few decades.  However, compared to the plethora of successful pre-clinical studies, only 15 passively targeted nanocarriers (NCs) have been approved for clinical use and none of the actively targeted NCs have advanced past clinical trials.  Herein, we review the principles behind targeted delivery approaches to determine potential reasons for their limited clinical translation and success.  We propose criteria and considerations that must be taken into account for the development of novel actively targeted NCs.  We also highlight the possible directions for the development of successful tumor targeting strategies.\n",

      "Nanoparticles have been proposed as carriers for drugs, genes and therapies to treat various diseases.  Many strategies have been developed to target nanomaterials to specific or over-expressed receptors in diseased cells, and these typically involve functionalizing the surface of nanoparticles with proteins, antibodies or other biomols.  Here, we show that the targeting ability of such functionalized nanoparticles may disappear when they are placed in a biol. environment.  Using transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles, we found that proteins in the media can shield transferrin from binding to both its targeted receptors on cells and sol. transferrin receptors.  Although nanoparticles continue to enter cells, the targeting specificity of transferrin is lost.  Our results suggest that when nanoparticles are placed in a complex biol. environment, interaction with other proteins in the medium and the formation of a protein corona can 'screen' the targeting mols. on the surface of nanoparticles and cause loss of specificity in targeting.\n",

      "Active targeting of nanoparticles to tumors can be achieved by conjugation with specific antibodies.  Specific active targeting of the HER2 receptor is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo with a s.c. MCF-7 breast cancer mouse model with trastuzumab-functionalized gold nanoparticles.  The no. of attached antibodies per nanoparticle was precisely controlled in a way that each nanoparticle was conjugated with either exactly one or exactly two antibodies.  As expected, in vitro we found a moderate increase in targeting efficiency of nanoparticles with two instead of just one antibody attached per nanoparticle.  However, the in vivo data demonstrate that best effect is obtained for nanoparticles with only exactly one antibody.  There is indication that this is based on a size-related effect.  These results highlight the importance of precisely controlling the ligand d. on the nanoparticle surface for optimizing active targeting, and that less antibodies can exhibit more effect.\n",

      "A review.  Multivalent interactions can be applied universally for a targeted strengthening of an interaction between different interfaces or mols.  The binding partners form cooperative, multiple receptor-ligand interactions that are based on individually weak, noncovalent bonds and are thus generally reversible.  Hence, multi- and polyvalent interactions play a decisive role in biol. systems for recognition, adhesion, and signal processes.  The scientific and practical realization of this principle will be demonstrated by the development of simple artificial and theor. models, from natural systems to functional, application-oriented systems.  In a systematic review of scaffold architectures, the underlying effects and control options will be demonstrated, and suggestions will be given for designing effective multivalent binding systems, as well as for polyvalent therapeutics.\n",

      "Inorg. nanoparticles are frequently engineered with an org. surface coating to improve their physicochem. properties, and it is well known that their colloidal properties may change upon internalization by cells.  While the stability of such nanoparticles is typically assayed in simple in vitro tests, their stability in a mammalian organism remains unknown.  Here, we show that firmly grafted polymer shells around gold nanoparticles may degrade when injected into rats.  We synthesized monodisperse radioactively labeled gold nanoparticles (198Au) and engineered an 111In-labeled polymer shell around them.  Upon i.v. injection into rats, quant. biodistribution analyses performed independently for 198Au and 111In showed partial removal of the polymer shell in vivo.  While 198Au accumulates mostly in the liver, part of the 111In shows a non-particulate biodistribution similar to i.v. injection of chelated 111In.  Further in vitro studies suggest that degrdn. of the polymer shell is caused by proteolytic enzymes in the liver.  Our results show that even nanoparticles with high colloidal stability can change their physicochem. properties in vivo.\n",

      "A review.  The emission of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) into the environment in increasing quantity and variety raises a general concern regarding potential effects on human health.  Compared with sol. substances, ENPs exhibit addnl. dimensions of complexity, i.e., they exist not only in various sizes, shapes and chem. compns. but also in different degrees of agglomeration.  The effect of the latter is the topic of this review in which we explore and discuss the role of agglomeration on toxicity, including the fate of nanomaterials after their release and the biol. effects they may induce.  In-depth investigations of the effect of ENP agglomeration on human health are still rare, but it may be stated that outside the body ENP agglomeration greatly reduces human exposure.  After uptake, agglomeration of ENPs reduces translocation across primary barriers such as lungs, skin or the gastrointestinal tract, preventing exposure of \"secondary\" organs.  In analogy, also cellular ENP uptake and intracellular distribution are affected by agglomeration.  However, agglomeration may represent a risk factor if it occurs after translocation across the primary barriers, and ENPs are able to accumulate within the tissue and thus reduce clearance efficiency.\n",

      "Colloidal CdSe/ZnS quantum dots were water solubilized by overcoating with an amphiphilic polymer.  Human serum albumin (HSA) as a model protein was either adsorbed or chem. linked to the surface of the polymer-coated quantum dots.  As the quantum dots are intrinsically fluorescent, and as the polymer coating and the HSA were fluorescent labeled, the final nanoparticle had three differently fluorescent components: the quantum dot core, the polymer shell, and the human serum albumin corona.  Cells were incubated with these hybrid nanoparticles, and after removal of non-internalized nanoparticles, exocytosis of the three components of the nanoparticles was obsd. individually by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.  The data indicate that HSA is partly transported with the underlying polymer-coated quantum dots into cells.  Upon desorption of proteins, those initially adsorbed to the quantum dots remain longer inside cells compared to free proteins.  Part of the polymer shell is released from the quantum dots by enzymic degrdn., which is on a slower time scale than protein desorption.  Data are quant. analyzed, and exptl. pitfalls, such as the impact of cell proliferation and fluorescence quenching, are discussed.\n",

      "A review.  Because of its safe and effective protein expression profile, in vitro transcribed mRNA (IVT-mRNA) represents a promising candidate in the development of novel therapeutics for genetic diseases, vaccines or gene editing strategies, esp. when its inherent shortcomings (for example, instability and immunogenicity) have been partially addressed via structural modifications.  However, numerous unsolved tech. difficulties in successful in vivo delivery of IVT-mRNA have greatly hindered the applications of IVT-mRNA in clin. development.  Recent advances in nanotechnol. and material science have yielded many promising nonviral delivery systems, some of which were able to efficiently facilitate targeted in vivo delivery of IVT-mRNA in safe and noninvasive manners.  The diversity and flexibility of these delivery systems highlight the recent progress of IVT-mRNA-based therapy using nonviral vectors.  In this review, we summarize recent advances of existing and emerging nonviral vector-based nanotechnologies for IVT-mRNA delivery and briefly summarize the interesting but rarely discussed applications on simultaneous delivery of IVT-mRNA with DNA.\n",

      "A review.  This review paper presents the overview of processes involved in transformation of org.-coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in biol. systems and in the aquatic environment.  The coating on AgNPs greatly influences the fate, stability, and toxicity of AgNPs in aq. solns., biol. systems, and the environment.  Several org.-coated AgNP systems are discussed to understand their stability and toxicity in biol. media and natural water.  Examples are presented to demonstrate how a transformation of org.-coated AgNPs in an aq. soln. is affected by the type of coating, pH, kind of electrolyte (mono- or divalent), ionic strength, org. ligands (inorg. and org.), org. matter (fulvic and humic acids), redox conditions (oxic and anoxic), and light.  Results of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and ecotoxicity of coated AgNPs to food chain members (plants, bacteria, and aquatic and terrestrial organisms) are reviewed.  Key factors contributing to toxicity are the size, shape, surface coating, surface charge, and conditions of silver ion release.  AgNPs may directly damage the cell membranes, disrupt ATP prodn. and DNA replication, alternate gene expressions, release toxic Ag+ ion, and produce reactive oxygen species to oxidize biol. components of the cell.  A progress made on understanding the mechanism of org.-coated AgNP toxicity using different anal. techniques is presented.\n",

      "Toxicity of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) has been reported both in vitro and in vivo.  However, the intracellular stability and chem. state of Ag NPs are still not very well studied.  In this work, we systematically investigated the cellular uptake pathways, intracellular dissoln. and chem. species, and cytotoxicity of Ag NPs (15.9 ± 7.6 nm) in Chinese hamster ovary cell subclone K1 cells, a cell line recommended by the OECD for genotoxicity studies.  Quantification of intracellular nanoparticle uptake and ion release was performed through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was employed to assess the chem. state of intracellular silver.  The toxic potential of Ag NPs and Ag+ was evaluated by cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) prodn. and live-dead cell staining.  The results suggest that cellular uptake of Ag NPs involves lipid-raft-mediated endocytosis and energy-independent diffusion.  The degrdn. study shows that Ag NPs taken up into cells dissolved quickly and XANES results directly indicated that the internalized Ag was oxidized to Ag-O- species and then stabilized in silver-sulfur (Ag-S-) bonds within the cells.  Subsequent cytotoxicity studies show that Ag NPs decrease cell viability and increase ROS prodn.  Pre-incubation with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, an efficient antioxidant and Ag+ chelator, diminished the cytotoxicity caused by Ag NPs or Ag+ exposure.  Our study suggests that the cytotoxicity mechanism of Ag NPs is related to the intracellular release of silver ions, followed by their binding to SH-groups, presumably coming from amino acids or proteins, and affecting protein functions and the antioxidant defense system of cells.\n",

      "The toxic effects of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) remain an issue of debate, where the resp. contribution of the NPs themselves and of free Ag+ ions present in the NP stock suspensions and after intracellular NP corrosion are not fully understood.  Here, we employ a recently set up methodol. based on high-content (HC) imaging combined with high-content gene expression studies to examine the interaction of three types of Ag NPs with identical core sizes, but coated with either mercapto-undecanoic acid (MUA), dodecylamine-modified poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PMA), or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-conjugated PMA with two types of cultured cells (primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and murine C17.2 neural progenitor cells).  As a control, cells were also exposed to free Ag+ ions at the same concn. as present in the resp. Ag NP stock suspensions.  The data reveal clear effects of the NP surface properties on cellular interactions.  PEGylation of the NPs significantly reduces their cellular uptake efficiency, whereas MUA-NPs are more prone to agglomeration in complex tissue culture media.  PEG-NPs display the lowest levels of toxicity, which is in line with their reduced cell uptake.  MUA-NPs display the highest levels of toxicity, caused by autophagy, cell membrane damage, mitochondrial damage, and cytoskeletal deformations.  At similar intracellular NP levels, PEG-NPs induce the highest levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but do not affect the cell cytoskeleton, in contrast to MUA- and PMA-NPs.  Gene expression studies support the findings above, defining autophagy and cell membrane damage-related necrosis as main toxicity pathways.  Addnl., immunotoxicity, DNA damage responses, and hypoxia-like toxicity were obsd. for PMA- and esp. MUA-NPs.  Together, these data reveal that Ag+ ions do contribute to Ag NP-assocd. toxicity, particularly upon intracellular degrdn.  The different surface properties of the NPs however result in distinct toxicity profiles for the three NPs, indicating clear NP-assocd. effects.\n",

      "To predict potential medical value or toxicity of nanoparticles (NPs), it is necessary to understand the chem. transformation during intracellular processes of NPs.  However, it is a grand challenge to capture a high-resoln. image of metallic NPs in a single cell and the chem. information on intracellular NPs.  Here, by integrating synchrotron radiation-beam transmission x-ray microscopy (SR-TXM) and SR-x-ray absorption near edge structure (SR-XANES) spectroscopy, the authors successfully capture the 3D distribution of silver NPs (AgNPs) inside a single human monocyte (THP-1), assocd. with the chem. transformation of silver.  The results reveal that the cytotoxicity of AgNPs is largely due to the chem. transformation of particulate silver from elemental silver (Ag0)n, to Ag+ ions and Ag-O-, then Ag-S- species.  These results provide direct evidence in the long-lasting debate on whether the nanoscale or the ionic form dominates the cytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles.  Further, the present approach provides an integrated strategy capable of exploring the chem. origins of cytotoxicity in metallic nanoparticles.\n",

      "Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) toxicity is related to their dissoln. in biol. environments and to the binding of the released Ag+ ions in cellulo; the chem. environment of recombined Ag+ ions is responsible for their toxicol. outcome, moreover it is indicative of the cellular response to AgNP exposure, and can therefore shed light on the mechanisms governing AgNP toxicity.  This study probes the chem. of Ag species in primary murine macrophages exposed to AgNPs by making use of X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy under cryogenic conditions: the linear combination anal. of the near-edge region of the spectra provides the fraction of Ag+ ions released from the AgNPs under a given exposure condition and highlights their complexation with thiolate groups; the ab initio modeling of the extended spectra allows measuring the Ag-S bond length in cellulo.  Dissoln. rates depend on the exposure scenario, chronicity leading to higher Ag+ release than acute exposure; Ag-S bond lengths are 2.41 ± 0.03 Å and 2.38 ± 0.01 Å in acute and chronic exposure resp., compatible with digonal AgS2 coordination.  Glutathione is identified as the most likely putative ligand for Ag+.  The proposed method offers a scope for the investigation of metallic nanoparticle dissoln. and recombination in cellular models.\n",

      "Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can enter eukaryotic cells and exert toxic effects, most probably as a consequence of the release of Ag+ ions.  Due to the elusive nature of Ag+ ionic species, quant. information concerning AgNP intracellular dissoln. is missing.  By using a synchrotron nanoprobe, silver is visualized and quantified in hepatocytes (HepG2) exposed to AgNPs; the synergistic use of electron microscopy allows for the discrimination between nanoparticular and ionic forms of silver within a single cell.  AgNPs are located in endocytosis vesicles, while the visualized Ag+ ions diffuse in the cell.  The averaged NP dissoln. rates, measured by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, highlight the faster dissoln. of citrate-coated AgNPs with respect to the less toxic PVP-coated AgNPs; these results are confirmed at the single-cell level.  The released Ag+ ions recombine with thiol-bearing biomols.: the Ag-S distances measured in cellulo, and the quant. evaluation of gene expression, provide independent evidence of the involvement of glutathione and metallothioneins in Ag+ binding.  The combined use of cutting-edge imaging techniques, at. spectroscopy and mol. biol. brings insight into the fate of AgNPs in hepatocytes, and more generally into the physicochem. transformations of metallic nanoparticles in biol. environments and the resulting disruption of metal homeostasis.\n",

      "It is qual. demonstrated that the intracellular localization of particles depends on the way they are administered, their basic physicochem. properties, as well as on incubation time.  For this purpose cells were exposed to fluorescently-labeled particles of different size under different exposure scenarios including incubation, microinjection, electroporation, and sonoporation.  After co-exposure to cells the intracellular distribution of different particles was imaged with multicolor fluorescence microscopy.

      "The encapsulation and release of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, and drugs in nanostructured lipid carriers depend on the type of the self-assembled liq.-cryst. organization and the structural dimensions of the aq. and membraneous compartments, which can be tuned by the multicomponent compn. of the systems.  In this work, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) investigation is performed on the melting' transition of the bicontinuous double diamond cubic phase, formed by pure glycerol monooleate (MO), upon progressive inclusion of varying fractions of pharmaceutical-grade glycerol monooleate (GO) in the hydrated system.  The self-assembled MO/GO mixts. are found to form diamond (Pn3m) inverted cubic, inverted hexagonal (HII), and sponge (L3) phases at ambient temp. in excess of aq. medium without heat treatment.  Mixing of the inverted-cubic-phase-forming MO and the sponge-phase-forming GO components, in equiv. proportions (50/50 wt./wt.), yields an inverted hexagonal (HII) phase nanostructured carrier.  Scattering models are applied for fitting of the exptl. SAXS patterns and identification of the structural changes in the aq. and lipid bilayer subcompartments.  The possibility of transforming, at ambient temp. (20°), the bicontinuous cubic nanostructures into inverted hexagonal (HII) or sponge (L3) mesophases may facilitate novel biomedical applications of the investigated liq. cryst. self-assemblies.\n",

      "A review.  Nanostructure bicontinuous cubic phase self-assembled materials are receiving expanding applications as biocompatible delivery systems in various therapeutic fields.  The functionalization of cubosome, spongosome, hexosome and liposome nanocarriers by pH-sensitive lipids and/or pH-sensitive polymer shells offers new opportunities for oral and topical drug delivery towards a new generation of cancer therapies.  The electrochem. behavior of drug compds. may favor pH-triggered drug release as well.  Here, we highlight recent investigations, which explore the phase behavior of mixed nonlamellar lipid/fatty acid or phospholipid systems for the design of pH-responsive and mucoadhesive drug delivery systems with sustained-release properties.  X-ray diffraction and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques are widely used in the development of innovative delivery assemblies through detailed structural analyses of multiple amphiphilic compns. from the lipid/co-lipid/water phase diagrams.  A pH-responsive nanoscale materials and nanoparticles are required for challenging therapeutic applications such as oral delivery of therapeutic proteins and peptides as well as of poorly water-sol. substances.  Perspective nanomedicine developments with smart cubosome nanocarriers may exploit compns. elaborated to overcome the intestinal obstacles, dual-drug loaded pH-sensitive liq. cryst. architectures aiming at enhanced therapeutic efficacy, as well as composite (lipid/polyelectrolyte) types of mucoadhesive controlled release colloidal cubosomal formulations for the improvement of the drugs' bioavailability.\n",

      "The structure of colloidal self-assembled drug delivery systems can be influenced by intermol. interactions between drug and amphiphilic mols., and is important to understand in the context of designing improved delivery systems.  Controlling these structures can enable controlled or targeted release systems for poorly water-sol. drugs.  Here we present the interaction of the hydrophobic vasoactive drug nicergoline with the internal structure of nanostructured emulsion particles based on the monoglyceride-water system.  Addn. of this drug leads to modification of the internal bicontinuous cubic structure to generate highly pH-responsive systems.  The colloidal structures were characterized with small-angle X-ray scattering and visualized using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.  Reversible transformations to inverse micelles at high pH, vesicles at low pH, and the modification of the spacing of the bicontinuous cubic structure at intermediate pH were obsd., and enabled the in situ detn. of an apparent pKa for the drug in this system-a difficult task using soln.-based approaches.  The characterization of this phase behavior is also highly interesting for the design of pH-responsive controlled release systems for poorly water-sol. drug mols.\n",

      "Studies of nonequil. lipid polymorphism at the nanoscale contribute to the in-depth understanding of the structural pathways for formation of aq. channels and emerging of channels-network ordering in liq.-cryst. (LC) nanovehicles.  The authors present exptl. structural evidence for the smallest tetrahedral-type lipid membrane aggregate, which involves completely formed nanochannels and occurs as an early intermediate state during the bilayer vesicle-to-cubosome particle transition.  Nanovehicles are generated from a self-assembled lipid mixt. and studied by high-resoln. cryogenic TEM (cryo-TEM) and synchrotron radiation small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS).  The studied lipid membrane compn. allows for the stabilization of long-lived intermediates throughout the unilamellar vesicle-to-cubosome nanoparticle (NP) transformation at ambient temp.  The obsd. small cubosomic particles, with well-defined H2O channels, appear to be precursors of larger cubic membrane structures, thus confirming the theor. modeling of nanochannel-network growth in diamond-type cubic lipid particles.  The reported structural findings, highlighting that bilayer vesicle membrane packing and fusion are required for nanochanneled cubosome particle formation, are anticipated to advance the engineering of small lipid NPs with controllable channels for biomol. loading and release.\n",

      "BACKGROUND:  Nanoparticle imaging and tracking the release of the loaded material from the nanoparticle system have attracted significant attention in recent years.  If the release of the loaded molecules could be monitored reliably in vivo, it would speed up the development of drug delivery systems remarkably.  METHODS:  Here, we test a system that uses indocyanine green (ICG) as a fluorescent agent for studying release kinetics in vitro and in vivo from the lipid iron nanoparticle delivery system.  The ICG spectral properties like its concentration dependence, sensitivity and the fluctuation of the absorption and emission wavelengths can be utilized for gathering information about the change of the ICG surrounding.  RESULTS:  We have found that the absorption, fluorescence, and photoacoustic spectra of ICG in lipid iron nanoparticles differ from the spectra of ICG in pure water and plasma.  We followed the ICG containing liposomal nanoparticle uptake into squamous carcinoma cells (SCC) by fluorescence microscopy and the in vivo uptake into SCC tumors in an orthotopic xenograft nude mouse model under a surgical microscope.  CONCLUSION:  Absorption and emission properties of ICG in the different solvent environment, like in plasma and human serum albumin, differ from those in aqueous solution.  Photoacoustic spectral imaging confirmed a peak shift towards longer wavelengths and an intensity increase of ICG when bound to the lipids.  The SCC cells showed that the ICG containing liposomes bind to the cell surface but are not internalized in the SCC-9 cells after 60 minutes of incubation.  We also showed here that ICG containing liposomal nanoparticles can be traced under a surgical camera in vivo in orthotopic SCC xenografts in mice.\n",

      "A review.  In recent years, much progress has been motivated in stimuli-responsive nanocarriers, which could response to the intrinsic physicochem. and pathol. factors in diseased regions to increase the specificity of drug delivery.  Currently, numerous nanocarriers have been engineered with physicochem. changes in responding to external stimuli, such as ultrasound, thermal, light and magnetic field, as well as internal stimuli, including pH, redox potential, hypoxia and enzyme, etc.  Nanocarriers could respond to stimuli in tumor microenvironments or inside cancer cells for on-demanded drug delivery and accumulation, controlled drug release, activation of bioactive compds., probes and targeting ligands, as well as size, charge and conformation conversion, etc. leading to sensing and signaling, overcoming multidrug resistance, accurate diagnosis and precision therapy.

      "Multiphoton imaging techniques that convert low-energy excitation to higher energy emission are widely used to improve signal over background, reduce scatter, and limit photodamage.  Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are among the most efficient multiphoton probes, but even UCNPs with optimized lanthanide dopant levels require laser intensities that may be problematic.  Here, we develop protein-sized, alloyed UCNPs (aUCNPs) that can be imaged individually at laser intensities >300-fold lower than needed for comparably sized doped UCNPs.  Using single UCNP characterization and kinetic modeling, we find that addition of inert shells changes optimal lanthanide content from Yb(3+), Er(3+)-doped NaYF4 nanocrystals to fully alloyed compositions.  At high levels, emitter Er(3+) ions can adopt a second role to enhance aUCNP absorption cross-section by desaturating sensitizer Yb(3+) or by absorbing photons directly.  Core/shell aUCNPs 12 nm in total diameter can be imaged through deep tissue in live mice using a laser intensity of 0.1 W cm(-2).\n",

      "Near IR (NIR) microscopy enables noninvasive imaging in tissue, particularly in the NIR-II spectral range (1000-1400 nm) where attenuation due to tissue scattering and absorption is minimized.  Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanocrystals are promising deep-tissue imaging probes due to their photostable emission in the visible and NIR, but these materials are not efficiently excited at NIR-II wavelengths due to the dearth of lanthanide ground-state absorption transitions in this window.  Here, the authors develop a class of lanthanide-doped imaging probes that harness an energy-looping mechanism that facilitates excitation at NIR-II wavelengths, such as 1064 nm, that are resonant with excited-state absorption transitions but not ground-state absorption.  Using computational methods and combinatorial screening, the authors have identified Tm3+-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles as efficient looping systems that emit at 800 nm under continuous-wave excitation at 1064 nm.  Using this benign excitation with std. confocal microscopy, energy-looping nanoparticles (ELNPs) are imaged in cultured mammalian cells and through brain tissue without autofluorescence.  The 1 mm imaging depths and 2 μm feature sizes are comparable to those demonstrated by state-of-the-art multiphoton techniques, illustrating that ELNPs are a promising class of NIR probes for high-fidelity visualization in cells and tissue.\n",

      "The major challenge in current chemotherapy is to increase local effective therapeutic concn. of drugs as well as to minimize toxicity and side effects for patients.  The targeted delivery of drugs to their desired site of action in a controlled manner plays an essential role in the development of drug formulations.  A photocage refers to a caged mol. rendered biol. inert by a photolabile protecting group.  Mols. are illuminated with light to liberate the caged group and then become active forms.  In this study, we formulate upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as the NIR-triggered targeting and drug delivery vehicles that successfully deliver in vitro and in vivo for near-IR light photocontrolled targeting, bioimaging, and chemotherapy.  It is noted that there has been no report on the systemic administration UCNP-based drug delivery agents for evaluation of bioimaging and chemotherapy.  To achieve phototargeting, the tumor-homing agent (i.e., folic acid) has been constructed as a photoresponsive mol.  For the chemotherapeutic effect, the antitumor drug doxorubicin is thiolated on the surface of UCNPs, forming a disulfide bond that can be cleaved by lysosomal enzymes within the cells.  The caged UNCPs can serve as a platform for the improvement of selective targeting and possible redn. of adverse side effects from chemotherapy.\n",

      "Efficient control over drug release is crit. to increasing drug efficacy and avoiding side effects.  An ideal drug delivery system would deliver drugs in the right amt., at the right location and at the right time noninvasively.  This can be achieved using light-triggered delivery: light is noninvasive, spatially precise and safe if appropriate wavelengths are chosen.  However, the use of light-controlled delivery systems has been limited to areas that are not too deep inside the body because UV or visible (Vis) light, the typical wavelengths used for photoreactions, have limited penetration and are toxic to biol. tissues.  The advent of upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) has made it possible to overcome this crucial challenge.  UCNPs can convert near-IR (NIR) radiation, which can penetrate deeper inside the body, to shorter wavelength NIR, Vis and UV radiation.  UCNPs have been used as bright, in situ sources of light for on-demand drug release and bioimaging applications.  These remote-controlled, NIR-triggered drug delivery systems are esp. attractive in applications where a drug is required at a specific location and time such as in anesthetics, postwound healing, cardiothoracic surgery and cancer treatment.  In this Perspective, we discuss recent progress and challenges as well as propose potential solns. and future directions, esp. with regard to their translation to the clinic.\n",

      "Stimuli-responsive drug delivery vehicles have garnered immense interest in recent years due to unparalleled progress made in material science and nanomedicine.  However, the development of stimuli-responsive devices with integrated real-time monitoring capabilities is still in its nascent stage because of the limitations of imaging modalities.  In this paper, we describe the development of a polypeptide-wrapped mesoporous-silica-coated multicolor upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP@MSN) as an ATP-responsive drug delivery system (DDS) for long-term tracking and real-time monitoring of drug release.  Our UCNP@MSN with multiple emission peaks in UV-NIR wavelength range was functionalized with zinc-dipicolylamine analog (TDPA-Zn2+) on its exterior surface and loaded with small-mol. drugs like chemotherapeutics in interior mesopores.  The drugs remained entrapped within the UCNP-MSNs when the nanoparticles were wrapped with a compact branched polypeptide, poly(Asp-Lys)-b-Asp, because of multivalent interactions between Asp moieties present in the polypeptide and the TDPA-Zn2+ complex present on the surface of UCNP-MSNs.  This led to luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) from the UCNPs to the entrapped drugs, which typically have absorption in UV-visible range, ultimately resulting in quenching of UCNP emission in UV-visible range while retaining their strong NIR emission.  Addn. of ATP led to a competitive displacement of the surface bound polypeptide by ATP due to its higher affinity to TDPA-Zn2+, which led to the release of the entrapped drugs and subsequent elimination of LRET.  Monitoring of such ATP-triggered ratiometric changes in LRET allowed us to monitor the release of the entrapped drugs in real-time.  Given these results, we envision that our proposed UCNP@MSN-polypeptide hybrid nanoparticle has great potential for stimuli-responsive drug delivery as well as for monitoring biochem. changes taking place in live cancer and stem cells.\n",

      "The authors report the first real-time tracking study with upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) at the single vesicle level in living cells.  Thanks to the remarkable photostability of UCNPs and the noninvasiveness of NIR excitation, the authors were able to visualize the intracellular movements of UCNPs for as long as 6 h without interruption.  The authors first assessed the benefits of using near-IR radiation as the excitation source to demonstrate the feasibility of long-term live-cell imaging with UCNPs.  The UCNPs (hexagonal phase NaYF4 codoped with Yb3+ and Er3+, ∼30 nm in diam.) coated by amphiphilic PEG-phospholipids were internalized into HeLa cells and imaged on a homemade epifluorescence microscope setup.  The dynamics of particle transport was composed of multiple phases within a single trajectory including the active transport by motor proteins such as dyneins and kinesins.  Further improvement in the optical upconversion efficiency and surface conjugation schemes will make UCNPs more versatile nanoparticle-based biolabels for intracellular proteins and organelles, accelerating diagnostic and therapeutic applications thereof.\n",

      "The development of probes for single-mol. imaging has dramatically facilitated the study of individual mols. in cells and other complex environments.  Single-mol. probes ideally exhibit good brightness, uninterrupted emission, resistance to photobleaching, and minimal spectral overlap with cellular autofluorescence.  However, most single-mol. probes are imperfect in several of these aspects, and none have been shown to possess all of these characteristics.  Here the authors show that individual lanthanide-doped up-converting nanoparticles (UCNPs) - specifically, hexagonal phase NaYF4 (β-NaYF4) nanocrystals with multiple Yb3+ and Er3+ dopants - emit bright anti-Stokes visible up-converted luminescence with exceptional photostability when excited by a 980-nm continuous wave laser.  Individual UCNPs exhibit no on/off emission behavior, or \"blinking,\" down to the millisecond time-scale, and no loss of intensity following an hour of continuous excitation.  Amphiphilic polymer coatings permit the transfer of hydrophobic UCNPs into water, resulting in individual water-sol. nanoparticles with undiminished photophys. characteristics.  These UCNPs are endocytosed by cells and show strong up-converted luminescence, with no measurable anti-Stokes background autofluorescence, suggesting that UCNPs are ideally suited for single-mol. imaging expts.\n",

      "Acquiring the temp. of a single living cell is not a trivial task.  In this paper, the authors devise a novel nanothermometer, capable of accurately detg. the temp. of solns. as well as biol. systems such as HeLa cancer cells.  The nanothermometer is based on the temp.-sensitive fluorescence of NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles, where the intensity ratio of the green fluorescence bands of the Er3+ dopant ions (2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) changes with temp.  The nanothermometers were first used to obtain thermal profiles created when heating a colloidal soln. of NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles in water using a pump-probe expt.  Following incubation of the nanoparticles with HeLa cervical cancer cells and their subsequent uptake, the fluorescent nanothermometers measured the internal temp. of the living cell from 25° to its thermally induced death at 45°.\n",

      "Advanced diagnostic procedures are required to satisfy the continuously increasing demands of modern biomedicine while also addressing the need for cost redn. in public health systems.  The development of IR luminescence-based techniques for in vivo imaging as reliable alternatives to traditional imaging enables applications with simpler and more cost-effective app.  To further improve the information provided by in vivo luminescence images, the design and fabrication of enhanced IR-luminescent contrast agents is required.  In this work, the authors demonstrate how simple dopant engineering can lead to IR-emitting rare-earth-doped nanoparticles with tunable (0.1-1.5 ms) and medium-independent luminescence lifetimes.  The combination of these tunable nanostructures with time-gated IR imaging and time domain anal. is employed to obtain multiplexed in vivo images that are used for complex biodistribution studies.\n",

      "Mech. forces affect a myriad of processes, from bone growth to material fracture to touch-responsive robotics.  While nano- to micro-Newton forces are prevalent at the microscopic scale, few methods have the nanoscopic size and signal stability to measure them in vivo or in situ.  Here, the authors develop an optical force-sensing platform based on sub-25 nm NaYF4 nanoparticles (NPs) doped with Yb3+, Er3+, and Mn2+.  The lanthanides Yb3+ and Er3+ enable both photoluminescence and upconversion, while the energetically coupled d-metal Mn2+ adds force tunability through its crystal field sensitivity.  Using a diamond anvil cell to exert up to 3.5 GPa pressure or ∼10 μN force per particle, the authors track stress-induced spectral responses.  The red (660 nm) to green (520, 540 nm) emission ratio varies linearly with pressure, yielding an obsd. color change from orange to red for α-NaYF4 and from yellow-green to green for d-metal optimized β-NaYF4 when illuminated in the near IR.  Consistent readouts are recorded over multiple pressure cycles and hours of illumination.  With the nanoscopic size, a dynamic range of 100 nN to 10 μN, and photostability, these nanoparticles lay the foundation for visualizing dynamic mech. processes, such as stress propagation in materials and force signaling in organisms.\n",

      "Mammals cannot see light over 700 nm in wavelength.  This limitation is due to the phys. thermodn. properties of the photon-detecting opsins.  However, the detection of naturally invisible near-IR (NIR) light is a desirable ability.  To break this limitation, we developed ocular injectable photoreceptor-binding upconversion nanoparticles (pbUCNPs).  These nanoparticles anchored on retinal photoreceptors as miniature NIR light transducers to create NIR light image vision with negligible side effects.  Based on single-photoreceptor recordings, electroretinograms, cortical recordings, and visual behavioral tests, we demonstrated that mice with these nanoantennae could not only perceive NIR light, but also see NIR light patterns.  Excitingly, the injected mice were also able to differentiate sophisticated NIR shape patterns.  Moreover, the NIR light pattern vision was ambient-daylight compatible and existed in parallel with native daylight vision.  This new method will provide unmatched opportunities for a wide variety of emerging bio-integrated nanodevice designs and applications.\n",

      "Optogenetics has revolutionized the exptl. interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurol. disorders.  It is limited, however, because visible light cannot penetrate deep inside brain tissue.  Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-IR (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific visible light.  Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep brain neurons.  Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged neurons in the ventral tegmental area, induced brain oscillations through activation of inhibitory neurons in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall.  UCNP technol. will enable less-invasive optical neuronal activity manipulation with the potential for remote therapy.\n",

      "Functionalization of nanocrystals is essential for their practical application, but synthesis on nanocrystal surfaces is limited by incompatibilities with certain key reagents.  The copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddn. is among the most useful methods for ligating mols. to surfaces, but has been largely useless for semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) because Cu+ ions quickly and irreversibly quench QD fluorescence.  To discover nonquenching synthetic conditions for Cu-catalyzed click reactions on QD surfaces, we developed a combinatorial fluorescence assay to screen >2000 reaction conditions to maximize cycloaddn. efficiency while minimizing QD quenching.  We identify conditions for complete coupling without significant quenching, which are compatible with common QD polymer surfaces and various azide/alkyne pairs.  Based on insight from the combinatorial screen and mechanistic studies of Cu coordination and quenching, we find that superstoichiometric concns. of Cu can promote full coupling if accompanied by ligands that selectively compete with the Cu from the QD surface but allow it to remain catalytically active.  Applied to the conjugation of a K+ channel-specific peptidyl toxin to CdSe/ZnS QDs, we synthesize unquenched QD conjugates and image their specific and voltage-dependent affinity for K+ channels in live cells.\n",

      "Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have demonstrated utility in long-term single particle tracking of membrane proteins in live cells in culture.  To extend the superior optical properties of QDs to more physiol. relevant cell platforms, such as acute brain slices, we examine the photophysics of compact ligand-conjugated CdSe/CdS QDs using both ensemble and single particle anal. in brain tissue media.  We find that sym. core passivation is crit. for both photostability in oxygenated media and for prolonged single particle imaging in brain slices.  We then demonstrate the utility of these QDs by imaging single dopamine transporters in acute brain slices, achieving 20 nm localization precision at 10 Hz frame rates.  These findings detail design requirements needed for new QD probes in complex living environments, and open the door to physiol. relevant studies that capture the utility of QD probes in acute brain slices.\n",

      "Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) proved to be superior probes for single-mol. imaging compared to org. or genetically encoded fluorophores, but they are limited by difficulties in protein targeting, their larger size, and on-off blinking.  Here, the authors report compact aq. CdSe/CdS QDs with significantly improved bioconjugation efficiency and superior single-mol. optical properties.  The authors synthesized covalent protein labeling ligands (i.e., SNAP tags) that are optimized for nanoparticle use, and QDs functionalized with these ligands label SNAP-tagged proteins ∼10-fold more efficiently than existing SNAP ligands.  Single-mol. anal. of these QDs shows 99% of time spent in the fluorescent on-state, ∼4-fold higher quantum efficiency than std. CdSe/ZnS QDs, and 350 million photons detected before photobleaching.  Bright signals of these QDs enable the authors to track the stepping movement of a kinesin motor in vitro, and the improved labeling efficiency enables tracking of single kinesins in live cells.\n",

      "We have presented a new modular approach for the immobilization on nanoparticles of peptide ligands selective for targeting specific cancer cells.  This method is based on the genetic encoding of the targeting protein, here an scFv antibody variant, which was produced in N-terminal-linked fusion with SNAP.  SNAP-scFv reacted quickly, efficiently, and in a site-directed manner with a 06-PEG-guanine deriv. anchored onto the nanoparticle surface, which resulted in the formation of a new covalent bond between the scFv and the nanocomplex with release of a guanine mol.  The potential of this strategy for nanoparticle bioengineering was demonstrated using an anti-HER2 scFv antibody that was immobilized on multifunctional nanoparticles, which proved very selective in targeting HER2 antigen in breast cancer cells.  As the polymer utilized in this study can be exploited for transporting various kinds of nanoparticles to water phase,I29I this approach can be considered of general value for the development of targeted nanoparticles for biomedical applications.\n",

      "A review.  Nanoparticles modified with ligands for specific targeting towards receptors expressed on the surface of target cells are discussed in literature towards improved delivery strategies.  In such concepts the ligand d. on the surface of the nanoparticles plays an important role.  How many ligands per nanoparticle are best for the most efficient delivery.  Importantly, this no. may be different for in vitro and in vivo scenarios.  In this review first viruses as \"biol.\" nanoparticles are analyzed towards their ligand d., which is then compared to the ligand d. of engineered nanoparticles.  Then, expts. are reviewed in which in vitro and in vivo nanoparticle delivery has been analyzed in terms of ligand d.  These results help to understand which ligand densities should be attempted for better targeting.  Finally synthetic methods for controlling the ligand d. of nanoparticles are described.\n",

      "For imaging with different modalities, labels, which provide contrast for all modalities, are required.  Colloidal nanoparticles composed out of an inorg. core and a polymer shell offer progress in this direction.  Both, the core and the polymer shell, can be synthesized to be fluorescent, magnetic, or radioactive.  When different cores are combined with different polymer shells, different types of particles for dual imaging can be obtained, as for example, fluorescent cores with radioactive polymer shells.

      "A review.  Radiometals comprise many useful radioactive isotopes of various metallic elements.  When properly harnessed, these have valuable emission properties that can be used for diagnostic imaging techniques, such as single photon emission computed tomog. (SPECT, e.g.67Ga, 99mTc, 111In, 177Lu) and positron emission tomog. (PET, e.g.68Ga, 64Cu, 44Sc, 86Y, 89Zr), as well as therapeutic applications (e.g.47Sc, 114mIn, 177Lu, 90Y, 212/213Bi, 212Pb, 225Ac, 186/188Re).  A fundamental crit. component of a radiometal-based radiopharmaceutical is the chelator, the ligand system that binds the radiometal ion in a tight stable coordination complex so that it can be properly directed to a desirable mol. target in vivo.  This article is a guide for selecting the optimal match between chelator and radiometal for use in these systems.  The article briefly introduces a selection of relevant and high impact radiometals, and their potential utility to the fields of radiochem., nuclear medicine, and mol. imaging.  A description of radiometal-based radiopharmaceuticals is provided, and several key design considerations are discussed.  The exptl. methods by which chelators are assessed for their suitability with a variety of radiometal ions is explained, and a large selection of the most common and most promising chelators are evaluated and discussed for their potential use with a variety of radiometals.  Comprehensive tables have been assembled to provide a convenient and accessible overview of the field of radiometal chelating agents.\n",

      "The development of novel prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted, radioactive theranostic agents is currently limited to facilities capable of working with high-energy radioisotopes.  Even preselection of lead structures in vitro relies mostly on radioactive assays with PSMA(+) LNCaP and PSMA(-) PC-3 cells.  Assays utilizing radioisotopes are time consuming, costly, and limit discovery to a small group of scientists with special facilities.  Nonradioactive alternatives are therefore needed in the field.  In this paper the authors describe an inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)-based method for the evaluation of PSMA-targeting ligands conjugated to DOTA-chelates of Europium.  The method is based on LNCaP and PC-3 cells and has been validated with the well-established targeting ligand PSMA-617.\n",

      "A review.  Tens of millions of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams are performed annually around the world.  The contrast agents, which improve diagnostic accuracy, are almost exclusively small, hydrophilic gadolinium(III) based chelates.  In recent years concerns have arisen surrounding the long-term safety of these compds., and this has spurred research into alternatives.  There has also been a push to develop new molecularly targeted contrast agents or agents that can sense pathol. changes in the local environment.  This comprehensive review describes the state of the art of clin. approved contrast agents, their mechanism of action, and factors influencing their safety.  From there we describe different mechanisms of generating MR image contrast such as relaxation, chem. exchange satn. transfer, and direct detection and the types of mols. that are effective for these purposes.  Next we describe efforts to make safer contrast agents either by increasing relaxivity, increasing resistance to metal ion release, or by moving to gadolinium(III)-free alternatives.  Finally we survey approaches to make contrast agents more specific for pathol. either by direct biochem. targeting or by the design of responsive or activatable contrast agents.\n",

      "The development of fluorophores and mol. probes for the second near-IR biol. window (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) represents an important, newly emerging and dynamic field in mol. imaging, chem. biol. and materials chem.  Because of reduced scattering, minimal absorption and negligible autofluorescence, NIR-II imaging provides high resoln., a high signal-to-noise ratio, and deep tissue penetration capability.  Among various state-of-the-art bioimaging modalities, one of the greatest challenges in developing novel probes is to achieve both high resoln. and sensitivity.  The chem. design and synthesis of NIR-II fluorophores suitable for multimodal imaging is thus emerging as a new and powerful strategy for obtaining high-definition images.  NIR-II fluorophores may convert NIR-II photons into heat for photothermal therapy and be excited by NIR-II light to produce singlet oxygen for photodynamic therapy.  The presence of simultaneous diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities in a single probe can be used for precise treatment.  In this review, we have focused on recent advances in the chem. design and synthesis of NIR-II fluorophores from small org. mols. to org. and inorg. nanoparticles, and we have further discussed recent advances and key operational differences in reported NIR-II imaging systems and biomedical applications based on NIR-II imaging, such as multimodal imaging, photothermal and photodynamic therapy, guidance for intraoperative surgery, and drug delivery.\n",

      "With the rising use of nanomaterials in everyday objects, an uptake of those materials by humans is very likely.  To assess their effect on the body, reliable detection of nanoparticles even in very low amts. in human blood becomes increasingly important.  Single-particle (SP) inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a fast and reliable method for counting and sizing particles at lowest concns., while simultaneously distinguishing between dissolved and particulate analytes.  For the first time to the authors' knowledge, a dedicated method validation approach for silver and gold nanoparticle anal. in human whole blood has been performed.  With only a little sample prepn., trueness expressed as bias with values below or equal to 5% and imprecision values <6% for particle size as well as an effective limit of detection of ∼20 nm are possible.  The concn. working range throughout all measured samples was in the nanogram per L range, making SP-ICP-MS a powerful tool in future nanotoxicol. applications and trace anal. of nanoparticles.\n",

      "To study pharmacokinetic properties of puerarin poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimer complex, a sensitive liq. chromatog. tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) was developed and validated to det. puerarin in rabbit aq. humor using microdialysis sampling.  Astilbin was used as the internal std.  The linear range for puerarin was from 2 to 1000 ng/mL (r = 0.9986) based on 20 μL of aq. humor.  The coeffs. of variations for intra-day and inter-day precisions were less than 10.0%, and the relative error of accuracy was within ±6.3%.  The mean extn. recovery of puerarin varied from 80.4% to 85.5%.  Microdialysis provides a complete concn. vs. time profile.  A significant difference was obsd. in main pharmacokinetic parameters of Cmax, AUC and t1/2 between puerarin soln. and puerarin PAMAM dendrimer complex.  Complex formation resulted in an obvious increase in bioavailability of puerarin after topical administration to rabbit according to the above LC-MS/MS assay method.\n",

      "A sensitive and specific liq. chromatog./mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantification of the modified γ-cyclodextrin Org 25969 and rocuronium bromide (Org 9426) in the plasma and urine of guinea pigs.  The assay was linear and reproducible over the range 25-10000 ng/mL for both compds.  The lowest limit of quantification (LLOQ) for both compds. in urine was 25 ng/mL.  In plasma, the LLOQ was 25 ng/mL for Org 9426 and 50 ng/mL for Org 25969.  The inter- and intraday variations were <20%.  The physicochem. properties of both compds. imposed different modes of extn. from plasma.  The modified γ-cyclodextrin was extd. by trifluoroacetic acid, pptn. while rocuronium was extd. by MeCN pptn.  Both compds. were quantified in urine by direct injection onto the column.  The LC/MS analyses of Org 25969 and Org 9426 were performed by using two different assay conditions.  It was not possible to quantify the complex of cyclodextrin and rocuronium, as it dissocd. on the LC column.  The use of LC/MS conferred great advantage to the quantification of both Org 25969 and Org 9426, as they are not chromogenic enough to afford the sensitivity and specificity required for the assay.\n",

      "The fate of polymer-coated Eu- and Bi-doped GdVO4 nanoparticles (NPs) of cubic shape upon cellular internalization was investigated.  After having been endocytosed by cells, the cubic Eu- and Bi-doped GdVO4 NP cores were partly dissolved and reshaped to rounded structures, which in control expts. could be ascribed to the acidic conditions present in endosomes/lysosomes.  With progress of time, there was a significant redn. in the amt. of internalized NPs per cell due to proliferation.  This was of higher extent than NP exocytosis.  Data of the study are compatible with the scenario that endosomal/lysosomal enzymes may partly digest the polymer shell around the NP cores, with enhanced exocytosis of the polymer fragments as compared to the NP cores.\n",

      "The transport and the delivery of drugs through nanocarriers is a great challenge of pharmacol.  Since the prodn. of liposomes to reduce the toxicity of doxorubicin in patients, a plethora of nanomaterials have been produced and characterized.  Although it is widely known that elementary properties of nanomaterials influence their in vivo kinetics, such interaction is often poorly investigated in many preclin. studies.  The present study aims to evaluate the actual effect of size and shape on the biodistribution of a set of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) after i.v. administration in mice.  To this goal, quant. data achieved by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and observational results emerging from histochem. (autometallog. and enhanced dark-field hyperspectral microscopy) were combined.  Since the immune system plays a role in bionano-interaction we used healthy immune-competent mice.  To keep the immune surveillance on the physiol. levels we synthesized endotoxin-free GNPs to be tested in specific pathogen-free animals.  Our study mainly reveals that (a) the size and the shape greatly influence the kinetics of accumulation and excretion of GNPs in filter organs; (b) spherical and star-like GNPs showed the same percentage of accumulation, but a different localization in liver; (c) only star-like GNPs are able to accumulate in lung; (d) changes in the geometry did not improve the passage of the blood brain barrier.  Overall, this study can be considered as a reliable starting point to drive the synthesis and the functionalization of potential candidates for theranostic purposes in many fields of research.\n",

      "The physicochem. properties of a set of 21 different gold nanoparticles (spherical and rod-shaped nanoparticles (NPs) of different diams. with three different surface coatings) were studied.  Protein corona formation, in vitro uptake, effect on cell viability and proliferation, and in vivo biodistribution of these NPs were detd.  The relation of the results of the different NPs was analyzed by hierarchical cluster anal., which will tell which NPs have the most similar physicochem. properties and biol. effects, without having to specify individual physicochem. parameters.  The results show that the physicochem. properties of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are mainly accounted for by their hydrodynamic diam. and their zeta-potential.  The formation of the protein corona is detd. by the pH-dependence of their zeta-potential.  While several reports found that in vitro uptake and in vivo biodistribution of NPs are correlated to individual physicochem. parameters, e.g., size, shape, or surface chem., such direct dependence in the investigated multidimensional set of NPs was not found in our study.  This most likely is due to entanglement of the different parameters, which complicates the prediction of the biol. effect of NPs in case multiple physicochem. properties are simultaneously varied.  The in vitro uptake and in vivo biodistribution of NPs seem to be not directly driven by the protein corona, but the physicochem. properties det. as well the corona as they influence in vitro/in vivo behaviors, and thus the effect of the protein corona would be rather indirect.\n",

      "Posttranslational modifications and proteolytic processing regulate almost all physiol. processes.  Dysregulation can potentially result in pathol. protein species causing diseases.  Thus, tissue species proteomes of diseased individuals provide diagnostic information.  Since the compn. of tissue proteomes can rapidly change during tissue homogenization by the action of enzymes released from their compartments, disease specific protein species patterns can vanish.  Recently, we described a novel, ultrafast and soft method for cold vaporization of tissue via desorption by impulsive vibrational excitation (DIVE) using a picosecond-IR-laser (PIRL).  Given that DIVE extn. may provide improved access to the original compn. of protein species in tissues, we compared the proteome compn. of tissue protein homogenates after DIVE homogenization with conventional homogenizations.  A higher no. of intact protein species was obsd. in DIVE homogenates.  Due to the ultrafast transfer of proteins from tissues via gas phase into frozen condensates of the aerosols, intact protein species were exposed to a lesser extent to enzymic degrdn. reactions compared with conventional protein extn.  In addn., total yield of the no. of proteins is higher in DIVE homogenates, because they are very homogenous and contain almost no insol. particles, allowing direct anal. with subsequent anal. methods without the necessity of centrifugation.  Enzymic protein modifications during tissue homogenization are responsible for changes of the in-vivo protein species compn.  Cold vaporization of tissues by PIRL-DIVE is comparable with taking a snapshot at the time of the laser irradn. of the dynamic changes that occur continuously under in-vivo conditions.  At that time point all biomols. are transferred into an aerosol, which is immediately frozen.\n",

      "Mass spectrometry (MS) imaging is a versatile method to analyze the spatial distribution of analytes in tissue sections.  It provides unique features for the analysis of drug compounds in pharmacokinetic studies such as label-free detection and differentiation of compounds and metabolites.  We have recently introduced a MS imaging method that combines high mass resolution and high spatial resolution in a single experiment, hence termed HR(2) MS imaging.  In the present study, we applied this method to analyze the spatial distribution of the anti-cancer drugs imatinib and ifosfamide in individual mouse organs.  The whole kidney of an animal dosed with imatinib was measured at 35 μm spatial resolution.  Imatinib showed a well-defined distribution in the outer stripe of the outer medulla.  This area was analyzed in more detail at 10 μm step size, which constitutes a tenfold increase in effective spatial resolution compared to previous studies of drug compounds.  In parallel, ion images of phospholipids and heme were used to characterize the histological features of the tissue section and showed excellent agreement with histological staining of the kidney after MS imaging.  Ifosfamide was analyzed in mouse kidney at 20 μm step size and was found to be accumulated in the inner medulla region.  The identity of imatinib and ifosfamide was confirmed by on-tissue MS/MS measurements.  All measurements including mass spectra from 10 μm pixels featured accurate mass (≤2 ppm root mean square) and mass resolving power of R = 30,000.  Selected ion images were generated with a bin size of αm/z = 0.01 ensuring highly specific information.  The ability of the method to cover larger areas was demonstrated by imaging a compound in the intestinal tract of a rat whole-body tissue section at 200 μm step size.  The described method represents a major improvement in terms of spatial resolution and specificity for the analysis of drug compounds in tissue sections.\n",

      "Cancer-cell heterogeneity dramatically influences treatment success, but escapes detection by classical histol.  Mass-spectrometric imaging (MSI) represents a powerful method for visualizing the spatial distribution of proteins in tissue sections.  Herein we asked whether MSI also facilitates detection of tumor heterogeneity.  We first transduced the human neuroendocrine-carcinoma BON cell line following the red-green-blue (RGB) marking principle.  RGB marking allows for specific color-coding of individual clones.  Mice transplanted with RGB-marked BON cells developed liver tumors.  We identified 16 primary tumors clearly distinguishable by histol. and fluorescence imaging, but also based on a common tumor-specific signal pattern detected by MSI.  Importantly, this pattern was clearly confined to tumor tissue while was absent from surrounding liver tissue.  At the same time, we obsd. protein signals differentially present in a few or even single tumors.  Since these signals were independent of RGB marking, they apparently reflected unique intrinsic protein-signal patterns of individual tumors.  Thus, our data propose MSI as a tool for identifying divergent tissue by 'fingerprints' of protein signals, allowing not only for differentiation of tumor from healthy tissue but also detection of tumor heterogeneity.  In conclusion, by visualizing tumor heterogeneity, MSI ideally complements microscopy-based methods.  This might help to better understand tumor biol. and develop future treatment strategies.\n",

      "Plant vacuoles are dynamic organelles that play essential roles in regulating growth and development.  Two distinct models of vacuole biogenesis have been proposed: sep. vacuoles are formed by the fusion of endosomes, or the single interconnected vacuole is derived from the endoplasmic reticulum.  These two models are based on studies of two-dimensional (2D) transmission electron microscopy and 3D confocal imaging, resp.  Here, we performed 3D electron tomog. at nanometer resoln. to illustrate vacuole biogenesis in Arabidopsis root cells.  The whole-cell electron tomog. anal. first identified unique small vacuoles (SVs; 400-1,000 nm in diam.) as nascent vacuoles in early developmental cortical cells.  These SVs contained intraluminal vesicles and were mainly derived/matured from multivesicular body (MVB) fusion.  The whole-cell vacuole models and statistical anal. on wild-type root cells of different vacuole developmental stages demonstrated that central vacuoles were derived from MVB-to-SV transition and subsequent fusions of SVs.  Further electron tomog. anal. on mutants defective in MVB formation/maturation or vacuole fusion demonstrated that central vacuole formation required functional MVBs and membrane fusion machineries.\n",

      "Cryo-electron tomog. (cryoET) has become a powerful technique at the interface of structural biol. and cell biol., due to its unique ability for imaging cells in their native state and detg. structures of macromol. complexes in their cellular context.  A limitation of cryoET is its restriction to relatively thin samples.  Sample thinning by cryo-focused ion beam (cryoFIB) milling has significantly expanded the range of samples that can be analyzed by cryoET.  Unfortunately, cryoFIB milling is low-throughput, time-consuming and manual.  Here, we report a method for fully automated sequential cryoFIB prepn. of high-quality lamellae, including rough milling and polishing.  We reproducibly applied this method to eukaryotic and bacterial model organisms, and show that the resulting lamellae are suitable for cryoET imaging and subtomogram averaging.  Since our method reduces the time required for lamella prepn. and minimizes the need for user input, we envision the technique will render previously inaccessible projects feasible.\n",

      "A review.  Innovations in liq.-phase electron microscopy (LP-EM) have made it possible to perform expts. at the optimized conditions needed to examine soft matter.  The main obstacle is conducting expts. in such a way that electron beam radiation can be used to obtain answers for scientific questions without changing the structure and (bio)chem. processes in the sample due to the influence of the radiation.  By overcoming these exptl. difficulties at least partially, LP-EM has evolved into a new microscopy method with nanometer spatial resoln. and sub-second temporal resoln. for anal. of soft matter in materials science and biol.  Both exptl. design and applications of LP-EM for soft matter materials science and biol. research are reviewed, and a perspective of possible future directions is given.\n",

      "As a promising tool over the optical resoln. limits, liq. electron microscopy is practically utilized to visualize the structural information on wet biol. specimens, such as cells, proteins, and nucleic acids.  However, the functionality of biomols. during their observation is still controversial.  Here we show the feasibility of live-cell electron microscopy using graphene veils.  We demonstrate that the electron dose resistivity of live bacterial cells increases to 100-fold in graphene veils, and thus they maintain their structures and functions after electron microscopy expts.  Our results provide the guidelines and show possibilities for the electron microscopy imaging of live cells and functional biomols.\n",

      "Electron microscopy of biol. cells in liq. provides unique nanoscale information.  A highly attractive idea is the capability to also study physiol. processes of live cells with electron microscopy.  However, this idea seems unrealistic because the minimal needed electron dose to obtain contrast is already many orders of magnitude above the LD known to cause reproductive-cell death.  We show here that claims of electron microscopy of viable cells in recent reports are based on a questionable interpretation of the used fluorescence live/dead assay.  A practical alternative to study biol. processes is correlative light and electron microscopy.\n",

      "While nanoparticles are usually designed for targeted drug delivery, they can also simultaneously provide diagnostic information by a variety of in vivo imaging methods.  These diagnostic capabilities make use of specific properties of nanoparticle core materials.  Near-infrared fluorescent probes provide optical detection of cells targeted by real-time nanoparticle-distribution studies within the organ compartments of live, anesthetized animals.  By combining different imaging modalities, we can start with deep-body imaging by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, and by using optical imaging, get down to the resolution required for real-time fluorescence-guided surgery.\n",

      "Interactions between plants and the soil's microbial & fungal flora are crucial for the health of soil ecosystems and food prodn.  Microbe-plant interactions are difficult to investigate in situ due to their intertwined relationship involving morphol. and metab.  Here, we describe an approach to overcome this challenge by elucidating morphol. and the metabolic profile of Medicago truncatula root nodules using Magnetic Resonance (MR) Microscopy, at the highest magnetic field strength (22.3 T) currently available for imaging.  A home-built solenoid RF coil with an inner diam. of 1.5 mm was used to study individual root nodules.  A 3D imaging sequence with an isotropic resoln. of (7μm)3 was able to resolve individual cells, and distinguish between cells infected with rhizobia and uninfected cells.  Furthermore, we studied the metabolic profile of cells in different sections of the root nodule using localized MR spectroscopy and showed that several metabolites, including betaine, asparagine/aspartate and choline, have different concns. across nodule zones.  The metabolite spatial distribution was visualized using chem. shift imaging.  Finally, we describe the tech. challenges and outlook towards future in vivo MR microscopy of nodules and the plant root system.\n",

      "Recently, the first magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) images at the cellular level in isolated mammalian brain tissues were obtained using microsurface coils.  These methods can elucidate the cellular origins of MR signals and describe how these signals change over the course of disease progression and therapy.  In this work, we explore the capability of these microimaging techniques to visualize mouse muscle fibers and their nuclei.  Isolated myofibers expressing lacZ were imaged with and without a stain for β-galactosidase activity (S-Gal + ferric ammonium citrate) that produces both optical and MR contrast.  We found that MRM can be used to image single myofibers with 6-μm resoln.  The ability to image single myofibers will serve as a valuable tool to study MR properties attributed to healthy and myopathic cells.  The ability to image nuclei tagged with MR/Optical gene markers may also find wide use in cell lineage MRI studies.\n",

      "Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool which is well-suited to directly resolve cellular structures in ex vivo and in vitro tissues without use of exogenous contrast agents.  Recent advances in its capability to visualize mammalian cellular structure in intact tissues have reinvigorated analytical interest in aquatic cell models whose previous findings warrant up-to-date validation of subcellular components.  Even if the sensitivity of MRM is less than other microscopic technologies, its strength lies in that it relies on the same image contrast mechanisms as clinical MRI which make it a unique tool for improving our ability to interpret human diagnostic imaging through high resolution studies of well-controlled biological model systems.  Here, we investigate the subcellular MR signal characteristics of isolated cells of Aplysia californica at an in-plane resolution of 7.8 μm.  In addition, direct correlation and positive identification of subcellular architecture in the cells is achieved through well-established histology.  We hope this methodology will serve as the groundwork for studying pathophysiological changes through perturbation studies and allow for development of disease-specific cellular modeling tools.  Such an approach promises to reveal the MR contrast changes underlying cellular mechanisms in various human diseases, for example in ischemic stroke.\n",

      "The low efficiency of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is caused by tumor hypoxia and the adaptive immune resistance/evasion of tumor cells, while the currently emerging immune checkpoint therapy restores the intrinsic immune capacities but can't directly attack the tumor cells.  Herein we report an integrated nanoplatform that combines PDT with immunotherapy to enhance photodynamic therapeutic effects and simultaneously inhibit tumor cells resistance/evasion.  To achieve this, we fabricated Mn@CaCO3/ICG nanoparticles and loaded them with PD-L1-targeting siRNA.  Thanks to the protection of CaCO3 on the loaded ICG and the oxygen produced by MnO2, an enhanced photodynamic therapeutic effect in vitro was obsd.  In vivo expts. demonstrated that the nanoplatform could efficiently deliver the loaded drug to the tumor tissues and significantly improve tumor hypoxia, which further contributes to the therapeutic effect of PDT in vivo.  Moreover, the synergistic benefits derived from the siRNA, which silenced the checkpoint gene PD-L1 that mediates the immune resistance/evasion, resulted in a surprising therapeutic effect to rouse the immune system.  The combination treatment strategy has great potential to be developed as a new and robust method for enhanced PDT therapy with high efficiency and a powerful antitumor immune response based on PD-L1 blockade.\n",

      "The recently emerged exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (ES-MIONs) (<5 nm) are promising T1-weighted contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to their good biocompatibility compared with Gd-chelates.  However, the best particle size of ES-MIONs for T1 imaging is still unknown because the synthesis of ES-MIONs with precise size control to clarify the relationship between the r1 (or r2/r1) and the particle size remains a challenge.  In this study, we synthesized ES-MIONs with seven different sizes below 5 nm and found that 3.6 nm is the best particle size for ES-MIONs to be utilized as T1-weighted MR contrast agent.  To enhance tumor targetability of theranostic nanoparticles and reduce the nonspecific uptake of nanoparticles by normal healthy cells, we constructed a drug delivery system based on the 3.6 nm ES-MIONs for T1-weighted tumor imaging and chemotherapy.  The laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and flow cytometry anal. results demonstrate that our strategy of precise targeting via exposure or hiding of the targeting ligand RGD2 on demand is feasible.  The MR imaging and chemotherapy results on the cancer cells and tumor-bearing mice reinforce that our DOX@ES-MION3@RGD2@mPEG3 nanoparticles are promising for high-resoln. T1-weighted MR imaging and precise chemotherapy of tumors.\n",

      "A review.  Advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of disease susceptibility coupled with prominent successes for mol. targeted therapies have resulted in an emerging strategy of personalized medicine.  This approach envisions risk stratification and therapeutic selection based on an individual's genetic makeup and physiol. state (the latter assessed through cellular or mol. phenotypes).  Molecularly targeted nanoparticles can play a key role in this vision through noninvasive assessments of mol. processes and specific cell populations in vivo, sensitive mol. diagnostics, and targeted delivery of therapeutics.  A superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle with a cross-linked dextran coating, or CLIO, is a powerful and illustrative nanoparticle platform for these applications.  These structures and their derivs. support diagnostic imaging by magnetic resonance (MRI), optical, and positron emission tomog. (PET) modalities and constitute a versatile platform for conjugation to targeting ligands.  A variety of conjugation methods exist to couple the dextran surface to different functional groups; in addn., a robust bioorthogonal [4 + 2] cycloaddn. reaction between 1,2,4,5-tetrazene (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) can conjugate nanoparticles to targeting ligands or label pretargeted cells.  The ready availability of conjugation methods has given rise to the synthesis of libraries of small mol. modified nanoparticles, which can then be screened for nanoparticles with specificity for a specific cell type.  Since most nanoparticles display their targeting ligands in a multivalent manner, a detailed understanding of the kinetics and affinity of a nanoparticle's interaction with its target (as detd. by surface plasmon resonance) can yield functionally important insights into nanoparticle design.  In this Account, we review applications of the CLIO platform in several areas relevant to the mission of personalized medicine.  We demonstrate rapid and highly sensitive mol. profiling of cancer markers ex vivo, as part of detailed, individualized mol. phenotyping.  The CLIO platform also facilitates targeted magnetic resonance and combined modality imaging (such as MR/PET/fluorescence/CT) to enable multiplexed measurement of mol. phenotypes in vivo for early diagnosis and disease classification.  Finally, the targeted delivery of a photodynamic therapy agent as part of a theranostic nanoparticle successfully increased local cell toxicity and minimized systemic side effects.\n",

      "A review.  Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopic techniques are widely used in humans both for clin. diagnostic applications and in basic research areas such as cognitive neuroimaging.  In recent years, new human MR systems have become available operating at static magnetic fields of 7T or higher (≥300MHz proton frequency).  Imaging human-sized objects at such high frequencies presents several challenges including non-uniform radiofrequency fields, enhanced susceptibility artifacts, and higher radiofrequency energy deposition in the tissue.  On the other side of the scale are gains in signal-to-noise or contrast-to-noise ratio that allow finer structures to be visualized and smaller physiol. effects to be detected.  This review presents an overview of some of the latest methodol. developments in human ultra-high field MRI/MRS as well as assocd. clin. and scientific applications.  Emphasis is given to techniques that particularly benefit from the changing phys. characteristics at high magnetic fields, including susceptibility-weighted imaging and phase-contrast techniques, imaging with X-nuclei, MR spectroscopy, CEST imaging, as well as functional MRI.  In addn., more general methodol. developments such as parallel transmission and motion correction will be discussed that are required to leverage the full potential of higher magnetic fields, and an overview of relevant physiol. considerations of human high magnetic field exposure is provided.\n",

      "Ion sensors based on colloidal nanoparticles (NPs), either as actively ion-sensing NPs or as nanoscale carrier systems for org. ion-sensing fluorescent chelators typically require a charged surface to be colloidally stable.  This surface charge significantly impacts the ion binding and affects the read-out.  Sensor read-out should be thus not detd. by the bulk ion concn., but by the local ion concn. in the nano-environment of the NP surface.  The authors present a conclusive model corroborated by exptl. data that reproduces the strong distance-dependence of the effect.  The exptl. data are based on the capability of tuning the distance of a pH-sensitive fluorophore to the surface of NPs in the nanometer (nm) range.  This in turn allows for modification of the effective acid dissocn. const. value (its logarithmic form, pKa) of analyte-sensitive fluorophores by tuning their distance to the underlying colloidal NPs.\n",

      "Upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) are promising tools for background-free imaging and sensing.  However, their usefulness for in vivo applications depends on their biocompatibility, which the authors define by their optical performance in biol. environments and their toxicity in living organisms.  For UCNPs with a ratiometric color response to mech. stress, consistent emission intensity and color are desired for the particles under nonmech. stimuli.  Here, the authors test the biocompatibility and mechanosensitivity of α-NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaLuF4 nanoparticles.  First, the authors ligand-strip these particles to render them dispersible in aq. media.  Then, the authors characterize their mechanosensitivity (∼30% in the red-to-green spectral ratio per GPa), which is nearly 3-fold greater than those coated in oleic acid.  The authors next design a suite of ex vivo and in vivo tests to investigate their structural and optical properties under several biorelevant conditions: over time in various buffers types, as a function of pH, and in vivo along the digestive tract of Caenorhabditis elegans worms.  Finally, to ensure that the particles do not perturb biol. function in C. elegans, the authors assess the chronic toxicity of nanoparticle ingestion using a reproductive brood assay.  In these ways, the authors det. that mechanosensitive UCNPs are biocompatible, i.e., optically robust and nontoxic, for use as in vivo sensors to study animal digestion.\n",

      "A review.  Cellular signalling is governed in large part by mech. forces and electromagnetic fields.  Mech. forces play a crit. role in cell differentiation, tissue organization and diseases such as cancer and heart disease; elec. fields are essential for intercellular communication, muscle contraction, neural signalling and sensory perception.  Therefore, quantifying a biol. system's forces and fields is crucial for understanding physiol. and disease pathol. and for developing medical tools for repair and recovery.  This Review highlights advances in sensing mech. forces and elec. fields in vivo, focusing on optical probes.  The emergence of biocompatible optical probes, such as genetically encoded voltage indicators, mol. rotors, fluorescent dyes, semiconducting nanoparticles, plasmonic nanoparticles and lanthanide-doped up-converting nanoparticles, offers exciting opportunities to push the limits of spatial and temporal resoln., stability, multi-modality and stimuli sensitivity in bioimaging.  We further discuss the materials design principles behind these probes and compare them across various metrics to facilitate sensor selection.  Finally, we examine which advances are necessary to fully unravel the role of mech. forces and elec. fields in vivo, such as the ability to probe the vectorial nature of forces, the development of combined force and field sensors, and the design of efficient optical actuators.\n",

      "Nanocarriers for chemo-photothermal therapy suffer from insufficient retention at the tumor site and poor penetration into tumor parenchyma.  A smart drug-dye-based micelle is designed by making the best of the structural features of small-mol. drugs.  P-DOX is synthesized by conjugating doxorubicin (DOX) with poly(4-formylphenyl methacrylate-co-2-(diethylamino) Et methacrylate)-b-polyoligoethyleneglycol methacrylate (P(FPMA-co-DEA)-b-POEGMA) via imine linkage.  Through the π-π stacking interaction, IR780, a near-IR fluorescence dye as well as a photothermal agent, is integrated into the micelles (IR780-PDMs) with the P-DOX.  The IR780-PDMs show remarkably long blood circulation (t1/2β = 22.6 h).  As a result, a progressive tumor accumulation and retention are presented, which is significant to the sequential drug release.  Moreover, when entering into a moderate acidic tumor microenvironment, IR780-PDMs can dissoc. into small-size conjugates and IR780, which obviously increases the penetration depth of drugs, and then improves the lethality to deep-seated tumor cells.  Owing to the high delivery efficiency and superior chemo-photothermal therapeutic efficacy of IR780-PDMs, 97.6% tumor growth in the A549 tumor-bearing mice is suppressed with a low dose of i.v. injection (DOX, 1.5 mg kg-1; IR780, 0.8 mg kg-1).  This work presents a brand-new strategy for long-acting intensive cancer therapy.\n",

      "Exosomes (Exos) of approx. 30-150 nm in diams. are the promising vehicles for therapeutic drugs.  However, several challenges still exist in clin. applications, such as unsatisfied yield of exosomes, complicated labeling procedure and low drug loading efficiency.  In this work, the gram-scale amt. of high-purity urinary exosomes can be obtained from gastric cancer patients by non-invasive method.  Passion fruit-like Exo-PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanovehicles were fabricated by considerable freshly-urinary Exos loaded efficiently with multi-functionalized PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanoparticles via instant electroporation strategy.  In this system, prepd. Exo-PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanovehicles could be internalized into cancer cells effectively, and could delay the endocytosis of macrophages and prolong blood circulation time owing to its membrane structure and antigens.  Under 633 nm laser irradn. and acidic condition, the structures of nanovehicles would be collapsed and tremendous PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanoparticles could be released inside cancer cells, produced considerable singlet oxygen, inhibiting growth of tumor cells.  In vivo expt. of MGC-803 tumor-bearing nude mice showed that prepd. Exo-PMA/Au-BSA@Ce6 nanovehicles could target tumor cells with deep penetration and superior retention performance in tumors.  This work reports a reliable conjugation-free labeling strategy for tracking exosomes harvested from human urine.  Moreover, the integration of multifunctional nanoparticles with urinary Exos paves a versatile road for the development of cancer-targeted photodynamic therapy.\n",

      "Recently, there is one-fifth of human deaths caused by cancer, leading to cancer treatment remains a hard nut to crack in the medical field.  Therefore, as an emerging diagnostic technol., mesoporous nanomaterials-based drug delivery systems integrated diagnosis and therapy have aroused tremendous interest owing to visually targeting effect and superior therapy efficacy compared with traditional cancer treatment.  In this work, we have successfully synthesized mesoporous carbon-gold hybrid nanozyme nanoprobes, whereby mesoporous carbon nanospheres were doped with small gold nanoparticles (OMCAPs) and further stabilized with a complex of reduced serum albumin and folic acid (rBSA-FA).  After loading IR780 iodide, the OMCAPs@ rBSA-FA@IR780 nanoprobes were finally accomplished for real-time imaging, photothermal/photodynamic and nanozyme oxidative therapy.  Herein, acid oxidized MCAPs possessed large surface area and numerous -COOH groups, which could be used to surface chem. modify numerous targeting mols. and load abundant NIR dye IR780, as well as be acted as photothermal reagents to enhance photothermal therapy effect.  In addn., the small Au NPs embedded in OMCAPs were utilized as nanozyme to catalyze H2O2 located in tumor cells to generate ·OH for intracellular oxidative damage of tumor.  Besides, as a commonly used near-IR (NIR) fluorescence dye, the loaded IR780 iodide could not only apply for real-time imaging, but also effectively enhance photo-thermal therapy (PTT) upon the 808 nm laser irradn.  Moreover, FA mols. could enhance the targeted efficiency of the nanoprobes to the gastric tumor site.  According to the systematical study in vitro and in vivo, our fabricated nanoprobes based on carbon-gold hybrid (OMCAPs@ rBSA-FA@IR780) revealed excellent tumor targeting efficacy, long tumor retention and favorably therapeutic effect for tumor.  All the results demonstrated that here synthesized probes exhibited excellently diagnostic and therapeutic performance, indicating our technol. may potentially offer an outstanding strategy for tumor-targeting theranostics.\n",

      "X-ray luminescent nanoparticles (NPs), including lanthanide fluorides, have been evaluated for application to deep tissue in vivo mol. imaging using optical tomog.  A combination of high material d., higher at. no. and efficient NIR luminescence from compatible lanthanide dopant ions indicates that particles that consist of ALnF4 (A = alk., Ln = lanthanide element) may offer a very attractive class of materials for high resoln., deep tissue imaging with X-ray excitation.  NaGdF4:Eu3+ NPs produced an X-ray excited luminescence that was among the most efficient of nanomaterials that have been studied thus far.  We have systematically studied factors such as (a) the crystal structure that changes the lattice environment of the doped Eu3+ ions within the unit cell; and extrinsic factors such as (b) a gold coating (with attendant biocompatibility) that couples to a plasmonic excitation, and (c) changes in the NPs surface properties via changes in the pH of the suspending medium-all with a significant impact on the X-ray excited luminescence of NaGdF4:Eu3+NPs.  The luminescence from an optimally doped hexagonal phase NaGdF4:Eu3+ nanoparticle was 25% more intense compared to that of a cubic structure.  We obsd. evidence of plasmonic reabsorption of midwavelength emission by a gold coating on hexagonal NaGdF4:Eu3+ NPs; fortunately, the NaGdF4:Eu3+ @Au core-shell NPs retained the efficient 5D0→7F4 NIR (692 nm) luminescence.  The NaGdF4:Eu3+ NPs exhibited sensitivity to the ambient pH when excited by X-rays, an effect not seen with UV excitation.  The sensitivity to the local environment can be understood in terms of the sensitivity of the excitons that are generated by the high energy X-rays (and not by UV photons) to crystal structure and to the surface state of the particles.\n",

      "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) could be highly selective and noninvasive, with low side effects as an adjuvant therapy for cancer treatment.  Because excitation sources such as UV and visible lights for most of the photosensitizers do not penetrate deeply enough into biol. tissues, PDT is useful only when the lesions are located within 10 mm below the skin.  In addn., there is no prior example of theranostics capable of both PDT and imaging with a single deep-penetrating X-ray excitation source.  Here we report a new theranostic scintillator nanoparticle (ScNP) composite in a core-shell-shell arrangement, i.e., NaLuF4:Gd(35%),Eu(15%)@NaLuF4:Gd(40%)@NaLuF4:Gd(35%),Tb(15%), which is capable of being excited by a single X-ray radiation source to allow potentially deep tissue PDT and optical imaging with a low dark cytotoxicity and effective photocytotoxicity.  With the X-ray excitation, the ScNPs can emit visible light at 543 nm (from Tb3+) to stimulate the loaded rose bengal (RB) photosensitizer and cause death of efficient MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancer cells.  The ScNPs can also emit light at 614 and 695 nm (from Eu3+) for luminescence imaging.  The middle shell in the core-shell-shell ScNPs is unique to sep. the Eu3+ in the core and the Tb3+ in the outer shell to prevent resonance quenching between them and to result in good PDT efficiency.  Also, it was demonstrated that although the addn. of a mesoporous SiO2 layer resulted in the transfer of 82.7% fluorescence resonance energy between Tb3+ and RB, the subsequent conversion of the energy from RB to generate 1O2 was hampered, although the loaded amt. of the RB was almost twice that without the mSiO2 layer.  A unique method to compare the wt % and mol % compns. calcd. by using the morphol. transmission electron microscope images and the inductively coupled plasma elemental anal. data of the core, core-shell, and core-shell-shell ScNPs is also introduced.\n",

      "Development of multimodal contrast agents for in vivo simultaneous multimodality imaging is an emerging interdiscipline that is paving the avenue toward the goal of personalized medicine.  Herein, folic acid-conjugated silica-modified LaF3:Yb,Tm upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs@SiO2-FA) with high La content in a single particle were strategically designed and prepd. for simultaneously targeting dual-modality imaging of upconversion luminescence (UCL) and X-ray computed tomog. (CT).  LaF3 UCNPs were synthesized by a novel oleic acid (OA)/ionic liq. (IL) two-phase system.  Afterward, a folic acid mol. was covalently anchored on the surface of UCNPs with a silane coupling agent.  The UCNPs@SiO2-FA exhibits good stability, water dispersibility and soly., low cytotoxicity, good biocompatibility, highly selective targeting, excellent X-ray attenuation, and UCL emission under excitation at 980 nm.  In vivo UCL and CT images of mice show the UCNPs@SiO2-FA can be used in targeting dual-modality imaging.  These results suggest that the as-prepd. nanoprobe is a good candidate with excellent imaging and targeting ability for targeting dual-modality imaging of UCL and CT.\n",

      "A review.  Achieving a spatial resoln. that is not limited by the diffraction of light, recent developments of super-resoln. fluorescence microscopy techniques allow the observation of many biol. structures not resolvable in conventional fluorescence microscopy.  New advances in these techniques now give them the ability to image three-dimensional (3D) structures, measure interactions by multicolor colocalization, and record dynamic processes in living cells at the nanometer scale.  It is anticipated that super-resoln. fluorescence microscopy will become a widely used tool for cell and tissue imaging to provide previously unobserved details of biol. structures and processes.\n",

      "Exposure of cells to colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) can have concn.-dependent harmful effects.  Mostly, such effects are monitored with biochem. assays or probes from mol. biol., i.e. viability assays, gene expression profiles, etc., neglecting that the presence of NPs can also drastically affect cellular morphol.  In the case of polymer-coated Au NPs upon NP internalization, cells undergo lysosomal swelling, alterations in mitochondrial morphol., disturbances in actin and tubulin cytoskeleton and assocd. signaling, and redn. of focal adhesion contact area and no. of filopodia.  Appropriate imaging and data treatment techniques allow for quant. analyses of these concn.-dependent changes.  Abnormalities in morphol. occur at similar (or even lower) NP concns. as the onset of reduced cellular viability.  Cellular morphol. is thus an important quant. indicator to verify harmful effects of NPs to cells, without requiring biochem. assays, but relying on appropriate staining and imaging techniques.\n",

      "DC-SIGN, a Ca2+-dependent transmembrane lectin, is found assembled in microdomains on the plasma membranes of dendritic cells.  These microdomains bind a large variety of pathogens and facilitate their uptake for subsequent antigen presentation.  In this study, DC-SIGN dynamics in microdomains were explored with several fluorescence microscopy methods and compared with dynamics for influenza hemagglutinin (HA), which is also found in plasma membrane microdomains.  Fluorescence imaging indicated that DC-SIGN microdomains may contain other C-type lectins and that the DC-SIGN cytoplasmic region is not required for microdomain formation.  Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements showed that neither full-length nor cytoplasmically truncated DC-SIGN in microdomains appreciably exchanged with like mols. in other microdomains and the membrane surround, whereas HA in microdomains exchanged almost completely.  Line-scan fluorescence correlation spectroscopy indicated an essentially undetectable lateral mobility for DC-SIGN but an appreciable mobility for HA within their resp. domains.  Single-particle tracking with defined-valency quantum dots confirmed that HA has significant mobility within microdomains, whereas DC-SIGN does not.  By contrast, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicated that inner leaflet lipids are able to move through DC-SIGN microdomains.  The surprising stability of DC-SIGN microdomains may reflect structural features that enhance pathogen uptake either by providing high-avidity platforms and/or by protecting against rapid microdomain endocytosis.\n",

      "The authors report on the remarkable two-photon excited fluorescence efficiency in the \"biol. window\" of CaF2:Tm3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles.  On the basis of the strong Tm3+ ion emission (at ∼800 nm), tissue penetration depths as large as 2 mm have been demonstrated, which are >4 times those achievable based on the visible emissions in comparable CaF2:Er3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles.  The outstanding penetration depth, together with the fluorescence thermal sensitivity demonstrated here, makes CaF2:Tm3+,Yb3+ nanoparticles ideal candidates as multifunctional nanoprobes for high contrast and highly penetrating in vivo fluorescence imaging applications.\n",

      "Multiphoton intravital microscopy (MP-IVM) is a powerful tool to image cells in vivo.  Its application in immunol. research has opened new horizons, allowing intravital imaging of leukocytes at the single-cell level.  A transparent cornea is vital to retain vision.  As an immune privileged site, a rapid innate response to foreign antigens is crucial in clearing opportunistic bacterial and viral pathogens, and minimizing collateral structural damage to the cornea.  Furthermore, dissecting the mechanisms and preventing the immunol. rejection process after corneal transplantation is imperative to retain sight.  Attempts of intravital imaging of mandibular dLNs have yielded little success to date, due to breathing artifacts and the location that is difficult to access.  Herein, we present the first MP-IVM mouse model of the mandibular dLNs, utilizing transgenic mice in which CD11c+ cells are fluorescently labeled.  The meandering index, an index for directionality, is significantly increased after allogeneic corneal transplantation at both 14 and 21 days, compared to steady state (p < 0.001).  Taken together, our study demonstrates the necessary methodol. required for intravital multiphoton imaging of the mandibular dLNs, allowing visualization of spatiotemporal kinetics of immune cells in vivo, and provides a window into the corneal immune reflex arc.  This technique will be a powerful tool to investigate the pathogenesis of ocular immune and inflammatory diseases.\n",

      "Quantification of the angular orientation distribution of fibrous tissue structures in scientific images benefits from the Fourier image anal. to obtain quant. information.  Measurement uncertainties represent a major challenge and need to be considered by propagating them in order to det. an adaptive anisotropic Fourier filter.  Our adaptive filter method (AF) is based on the max. relative uncertainty δcut of the power spectrum as well as a weighted radial sum with weighting factor α.  We use a Monte-Carlo simulation to obtain realistic greyscale images that include defined variations in fiber thickness, length, and angular dispersion as well as variations in noise.  From this simulation the best agreement between predefined and derived angular orientation distribution is found for evaluation parameters δcut = 2.1% and α = 1.5.  The resulting cumulative orientation distribution was modeled by a sigmoid function to obtain the mean angle and the fiber dispersion.  A comparison to a state-of-the-art band-pass method revealed that the AF method is more suitable for the application on greyscale fiber images, since the error of the fiber dispersion significantly decreased from (33.9 ± 26.5)% to (13.2 ± 12.7)%.  Both methods were found to accurately quantify the mean fiber orientation with an error of (1.9 ± 1.5)° and (2.3 ± 2.1)° in case of the AF and the band-pass method, resp.  We demonstrate that the AF method is able to accurately quantify the fiber orientation distribution in in vivo second-harmonic generation images of dermal collagen with a mean fiber orientation error of (6.0 ± 4.0)° and a dispersion error of (9.3 ± 12.1)%.\n",

      "Mitochondria form dynamic networks which adapt to the environmental requirements of the cell.  We investigated the aging process of these networks in human skin cells in vivo by multiphoton microscopy.  A study on the age-dependency of the mitochondrial network in young and old volunteers revealed that keratinocytes in old skin establish a significantly more fragmented network with smaller and more compact mitochondrial clusters than keratinocytes in young skin.  Furthermore, we investigated the mitochondrial network during differentiation processes of keratinocytes within the epidermis of volunteers.  We observe a fragmentation similar to the age-dependent study in almost all parameters.  These parallels raise questions about the dynamics of biophys. network structures during aging processes.\n",

      "Raman micro-spectroscopy provides a convenient non-destructive and location-specific means of probing cellular physiol. and tissue physiol. at sub-micron length scales.  By probing the vibrational signature of mols. and mol. groups, the distribution and metabolic products of small mols. that cannot be labeled with fluorescent dyes can be analyzed.  This method works well for mol. concns. in the micro-molar range and has been demonstrated as a valuable tool for monitoring drug-cell interactions.  If the small mol. of interest does not contain groups that would allow for a discrimination against cytoplasmic background signals, \"labeling\" of the mol. by isotope substitution or by incorporating other unique small groups, e.g. alkynes provides a stable signal even for time-lapse imaging such compds. in living cells.  In this review we highlight recent progress in assessing the physiol. of cells and tissue by Raman spectroscopy and imaging.\n",

      "A review.  The discovery of the enhancement of Raman scattering by mols. adsorbed on nanostructured metal surfaces is a landmark in the history of spectroscopic and anal. techniques.  Significant exptl. and theor. effort has been directed toward understanding the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect and demonstrating its potential in various types of ultrasensitive sensing applications in a wide variety of fields.  In the 45 years since its discovery, SERS has blossomed into a rich area of research and technol., but addnl. efforts are still needed before it can be routinely used anal. and in com. products.  In this Review, prominent authors from around the world joined together to summarize the state of the art in understanding and using SERS and to predict what can be expected in the near future in terms of research, applications, and technol. development.  This Review is dedicated to SERS pioneer and our coauthor, the late Prof. Richard Van Duyne, whom we lost during the prepn. of this article.\n",

      "Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful technique for characterization of biol. samples.  SERS spectra from healthy brain tissue and tumors are obtained by sudden freezing of tissue in liq. nitrogen and crashing and mixing it with a concd. silver colloidal suspension.  The acquired spectra from tissues show significant spectral differences that can be used to identify whether it is from a healthy region or tumor.  The most significant change on SERS spectra from the healthy/peripheral brain tissue to tumor is the increase of the ratio of the peaks at around 723 to 655 cm-1.  In addn., the spectral changes indicate that the protein content in tumors increases compared to the peripheral/healthy tissue as obsd. with tumor invasion.  The preliminary results show that SERS spectra can be used for a quick diagnosis due to the simplicity of the sample prepn. and the speed of the spectral acquisition.\n",

      "The in cellulo assembly of plasmonic nanomaterials into photo-responsive probes is of great interest for many bioimaging and nanophotonic applications but remains challenging with traditional nucleic acid scaffolds-based bottom-up methods.  Here, we address this quandary using split-fluorescent protein (FP) fragments as molecular glue and switchable Raman reporters to assemble gold or silver plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) into photonic clusters directly in live cells.  When targeted to diffusing surface biomarkers in cancer cells, the NPs self-assemble into surface-enhanced Raman-scattering (SERS) nanoclusters having hot spots homogenously seeded by the reconstruction of full-length FPs.  Within plasmonic hot spots, autocatalytic activation of the FP chromophore and near-field amplification of its Raman fingerprints enable selective and sensitive SERS imaging of targeted cells.  This FP-driven assembly of metal colloids also yields enhanced photoacoustic signals, allowing the hybrid FP/NP nanoclusters to serve as contrast agents for multimodal SERS and photoacoustic microscopy with single-cell sensitivity.\n",

      "A review.  The authors have recently witnessed a major improvement in the quality of nanoparticles encoded with Raman-active mols. (SERS tags).  Such a progress relied mainly on a major improvement of fabrication methods for building-blocks, resulting in widespread application of this powerful tool in various fields, with the potential to replace commonly used techniques, such as those based on fluorescence.  The authors present hereby a brief perspective on SERS tags, regarding their compn., morphol. and structure, and describe the own selection from the current state-of-the-art.  The authors then focus on the main bioimaging applications of SERS tags, showing a gradual evolution from two-dimensional studies to three-dimensional anal.  Recent improvements in sensitivity and multiplexing ability have enabled great advancements toward in vivo applications, e.g. highlighting tumor boundaries to guide surgery.  In addn., the high level of biomol. sensitivity reached by SERS tags, promises an expansion toward biomarker detection in cases for which traditional methods offer limited reliability, as a consequence of the frequently low analyte concns.\n",

This Perspective article aims at summarizing the exptl. complexities, in particular, those related to the interaction of light with the sample, that the SERS practitioner may find when acquiring a spectrum while providing a general basis for the interpretation of the obtained vibrational features.  With such an idea in mind, factors related to the instrumentation, the optical enhancer, and the analyte mol. are discussed to illustrate the effects of the incident light on the abs. and relative intensity, as well as the spectral profile of the SERS spectra.\n",

      "A review.  In vivo imaging, which enables researchers to peer deeply within living subjects, is producing tremendous opportunities both for clin. diagnostics and as a research tool.  Contrast material is often required to clearly visualize the functional architecture of physiol. structures.  Recent advances in nanomaterials are becoming pivotal to generate the high-resoln., high-contrast images needed for accurate, precision diagnostics.  Nanomaterials are playing major roles in imaging by delivering large imaging payloads, yielding improved sensitivity, multiplexing capacity, and modularity of design.  Indeed, for several imaging modalities, nanomaterials are now not simply ancillary contrast entities, but are instead the original and sole source of image signal that make possible the modality's existence.  The authors address the physicochem. makeup/design of nanomaterials through the lens of the phys. properties that produce contrast signal for the cognate imaging modality; the authors stratify nanomaterials on the basis of their (1) magnetic, (2) optical, (3) acoustic, and/or (4) nuclear properties.  The authors evaluate them for their ability to provide relevant information under preclin. and clin. circumstances, their in vivo safety profiles (which are being incorporated into their chem. design), their modularity in being fused to create multimodal nanomaterials (spanning multiple different phys. imaging modalities and therapeutic/theranostic capabilities), their key properties, and critically their likelihood to be clin. translated.\n",

      "Raman spectroscopy is a newly developed, noninvasive preclin. imaging technique that offers picomolar sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities to the field of mol. imaging.  In this study, we demonstrate the ability of Raman spectroscopy to sep. the spectral fingerprints of up to 10 different types of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles in a living mouse after s.c. injection.  Based on these spectral results, we simultaneously injected the five most intense and spectrally unique SERS nanoparticles i.v. to image their natural accumulation in the liver.  All five types of SERS nanoparticles were successfully identified and spectrally sepd. using our optimized noninvasive Raman imaging system.  In addn., we were able to linearly correlate Raman signal with SERS concn. after injecting four spectrally unique SERS nanoparticles either s.c. (R2 = 0.998) or i.v. (R2 = 0.992).  These results show great potential for multiplexed imaging in living subjects in cases in which several targeted SERS probes could offer better detection of multiple biomarkers assocd. with a specific disease.\n",

      "Labeled nanoparticles have attracted much interest toward applications in bioimaging and diagnostics.  In particular, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotags have been demonstrated to be excellent candidates for multiplexed imaging and biol. detection.  The authors propose an alternative, effective method to easily prep. gold nanostars exhibiting plasmon bands in the near IR range, encoded with Raman reporter mols., concomitantly acting as capping agents which are then protected with an amphiphilic polymer.  The resulting nanotags are non-cytotoxic and display long-term stability against aggregation and reporter leakage, while showing reproducible SERS signals suitable for multiplexing.  These tags were used to distinguish five different types of breast cancer cells by imaging of a quintuple cell coculture.  Time-lapse SERS imaging of the coculture was addnl. performed, demonstrating the applicability of these nanotags for cell tracing over time scales >24 h.\n",

      "Methods to image complex 3D cell cultures are limited by issues such as fluorophore photobleaching and decompn., poor excitation light penetration, and lack of complementary techniques to verify the 3D structure.  Although it remains insufficiently demonstrated, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging is a promising tool for the characterization of biol. complex systems.  To this aim, a controllable 3D cell culture model which spans nearly 1 cm2 in surface footprint is designed.  This structure is composed of fibroblasts contg. SERS-encoded nanoparticles (i.e., SERS tags), arranged in an alternating layered structure.  This \"sandwich\" type structure allows monitoring of the SERS signals in the z-axis and with mm dimensions in the xy-axis.  Taking advantage of correlative microscopy techniques such as electron microscopy, it is possible to corroborate nanoparticle positioning and distances in z-depths of up to 150μm.  This study reveals a proof-of-concept method for detailed 3D SERS imaging of a complex, dense 3D cell culture model.\n",

      "A review.  Changes in protein expression levels and protein structure may indicate genomic mutations and may be related to some diseases.  Therefore, the precise quantification and characterization of proteins can be used for disease diagnosis.  Compared with several other alternative methods, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy is regarded as an excellent choice for the quantification and structural characterization of proteins.  Herein, the authors review the main advance of using plasmonic nanostructures as SERS sensing platform for this purpose.  Three design approaches, including direct SERS, indirect SERS, and SERS-encoded nanoparticles, are discussed in the direction of developing new precise approaches of quantification and characterization of proteins.  While this Review is focused on proteins, in order to highlight concepts of SERS-based sensors also detection of other biomols. will be discussed.\n",

The nanocomposites were loaded, as a proof of concept, with bisbenzimide mols. as functional cargo and wrapped with an amphiphilic polymer that prevents ZIF-8 degrdn. and bisbenzimide leaking in aq. media or inside living cells.  The demonstrated mol.-release mechanism relies on the use of near-IR light coupled to the plasmonic absorption of the core gold nanostars, which creates local temp. gradients and thus, bisbenzimide thermodiffusion.  Confocal microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) were used to demonstrate bisbenzimide loading/leaking and near-IR-triggered cargo release inside cells, thereby leading to DNA staining.\n",

      "PURPOSE:  In preclinical cancer studies, non-invasive functional imaging has become an important tool to assess tumor development and therapeutic effects.  Tumor hypoxia is closely associated with tumor aggressiveness and is therefore a key parameter to be monitored.  Recently, photoacoustic (PA) imaging with inherently co-registered high-frequency ultrasound (US) has reached preclinical applicability, allowing parallel collection of anatomical and functional information.  Dual-wavelength PA imaging can be used to quantify tissue oxygen saturation based on the absorbance spectrum differences between hemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin.  EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:  A new bi-modal PA/US system for small animal imaging was employed to test feasibility and reliability of dual-wavelength PA for measuring relative tissue oxygenation.  Murine models of pancreatic and colon cancer were imaged, and differences in tissue oxygenation were compared to immunohistochemistry for hypoxia in the corresponding tissue regions.  RESULTS:  Functional studies proved feasibility and reliability of oxygenation detection in murine tissue in vivo.  Tumor models exhibited different levels of hypoxia in localized regions, which positively correlated with immunohistochemical staining for hypoxia.  Contrast-enhanced imaging yielded complementary information on tissue perfusion using the same system.  CONCLUSION:  Bimodal PA/US imaging can be utilized to reliably detect hypoxic tumor regions in murine tumor models, thus providing the possibility to collect anatomical and functional information on tumor growth and treatment response live in longitudinal preclinical studies.\n",

      "Ultrasound is among the most widely used biomedical imaging modalities, but has limited ability to image specific mol. targets due to the lack of suitable nanoscale contrast agents.  Gas vesicles, genetically encoded protein nanostructures isolated from buoyant photosynthetic microbes, have recently been identified as nanoscale reporters for ultrasound.  Their unique phys. properties give gas vesicles significant advantages over conventional microbubble contrast agents, including nanoscale dimensions and inherent phys. stability.  Furthermore, as a genetically encoded material, gas vesicles present the possibility that the nanoscale mech., acoustic, and targeting properties of an imaging agent can be engineered at the level of its constituent proteins.  Here, genetic engineering of gas vesicles results in nanostructures with new mech., acoustic, surface, and functional properties to enable harmonic, multiplexed, and multimodal ultrasound imaging as well as cell-specific mol. targeting.  These results establish a biomol. platform for the engineering of acoustic nanomaterials.\n",

      "Phagocytic clearance and lysosomal processing of pathogens and debris are essential functions of the innate immune system.  However, the assessment of these functions in vivo is challenging because most nanoscale contrast agents compatible with noninvasive imaging techniques are made from nonbiodegradable synthetic materials that do not undergo regular lysosomal degrdn.  To overcome this challenge, the authors describe the use of an all-protein contrast agent to directly visualize and quantify phagocytic and lysosomal activities in vivo by ultrasound imaging.  This contrast agent is based on gas vesicles (GVs), a class of air-filled protein nanostructures naturally expressed by buoyant microbes.  Using a combination of ultrasound imaging, pharmacol., immunohistol., and live-cell optical microscopy, after i.v. injection, GVs are cleared from circulation by liver-resident macrophages.  Once internalized, the GVs undergo lysosomal degrdn., resulting in the elimination of their ultrasound contrast.  By noninvasively monitoring the temporal dynamics of GV-generated ultrasound signal in circulation and in the liver and fitting them with a pharmacokinetic model, the authors can quantify the rates of phagocytosis and lysosomal degrdn. in living animals.  The authors demonstrate the utility of this method by showing how these rates are perturbed in two models of liver dysfunction: phagocyte deficiency and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.  The combination of proteolytically degradable nanoscale contrast agents and quant. ultrasound imaging thus enables noninvasive functional imaging of cellular degradative processes.\n",

      "Ultrasound is among the most widely used non-invasive imaging modalities in biomedicine, but plays a surprisingly small role in mol. imaging due to a lack of suitable mol. reporters on the nanoscale.  Here, we introduce a new class of reporters for ultrasound based on genetically encoded gas nanostructures from microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.  Gas vesicles are gas-filled protein-shelled compartments with typical widths of 45-250 nm and lengths of 100-600 nm that exclude water and are permeable to gas.  We show that gas vesicles produce stable ultrasound contrast that is readily detected in vitro and in vivo, that their genetically encoded phys. properties enable multiple modes of imaging, and that contrast enhancement through aggregation permits their use as mol. biosensors.\n",

      "The optical technol. presents non-invasive, non-destructive, and non-ionizing features and has the ability to display various chem. components in tissues to provide useful information for various biomedical applications.  Regarding selection of light wavelengths, second near-IR (NIR-II, 900-1700 nm) light is a much better choice compared to both visible (380-780 nm) and traditional near-IR (780-900 nm) light, because of its advantages including deeper penetration into biol. tissues, less tissue scattering or absorption, and decreased interference by fluorescent proteins.  Thus, using optical nano-agents that absorb or emit light in the NIR-II window can achieve deeper tissue optical imaging with higher signal-to-background ratios and better spatial resoln. for diagnosis.  What's more, some of these nano-agents can be further applied for imaging guided surgical removal, real-time monitoring of drug delivery, labeling lymphatic metastasis, biosensing, and imaging guided phototherapy.  In this review, we attempt to summarize the recent advances of various NIR-II nano-agents (including single-walled carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, rare-earth doped nanoparticles, other inorg. nanomaterials, small org. mol.-based nanoparticles, and semiconducting polymer nanoparticles) in both bioimaging and therapeutic applications, and discuss the challenges and perspectives of these nano-agents for clin. practice in the near future.\n",

      "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has emerged as a novel, non-invasive imaging modality that allows the detailed study of flow within the vascular structures of the eye.  Compared to conventional dye angiography, OCTA can produce more detailed, higher resolution images of the vasculature without the added risk of dye injection.  In our review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this new technology in comparison to conventional dye angiography.  We provide an overview of the current OCTA technology available, compare the various commercial OCTA machines technical specifications and discuss some future software improvements.  An approach to the interpretation of OCTA images by correlating images to other multimodal imaging with attention to identifying potential artefacts will be outlined and may be useful to ophthalmologists, particularly those who are currently still unfamiliar with this new technology.  This review is based on a search of peer-reviewed published papers relevant to OCTA according to our current knowledge, up to January 2017, available on the PubMed database.  Currently, many of the published studies have focused on OCTA imaging of the retina, in particular, the use of OCTA in the diagnosis and management of common retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and retinal vascular diseases.  In addition, we describe clinical applications for OCTA imaging in inflammatory diseases, optic nerve diseases and anterior segment diseases.  This review is based on both the current literature and the clinical experience of our individual authors, with an emphasis on the clinical applications of this imaging technology.\n",

      "Acquisition of high-resoln. images from within internal organs using endoscopic optical imaging has numerous clin. applications.  However, difficulties assocd. with optical aberrations and the trade-off between transverse resoln. and depth of focus significantly limit the scope of applications.  Here, we integrate a metalens, with the ability to modify the phase of incident light at subwavelength level, into the design of an endoscopic optical coherence tomog. catheter (termed nano-optic endoscope) to achieve near diffraction-limited imaging through negating non-chromatic aberrations.  Remarkably, the tailored chromatic dispersion of the metalens in the context of spectral interferometry is utilized to maintain high-resoln. imaging beyond the input field Rayleigh range, easing the trade-off between transverse resoln. and depth of focus.  We demonstrate endoscopic imaging in resected human lung specimens and in sheep airways in vivo.  The combination of the superior resoln. and higher imaging depth of focus of the nano-optic endoscope is likely to increase the clin. utility of endoscopic optical imaging.\n",

      "Optical coherence tomog. (OCT) is an emerging biomedical optical imaging technique that performs high-resoln., cross-sectional tomog. imaging of microstructure in biol. systems.  OCT can achieve image resolns. of 1-15 μm, one to two orders of magnitude finer than std. ultrasound.  The image penetration depth of OCT is detd. by the optical scattering and is up to 2-3 mm in tissue.  OCT functions as a type of 'optical biopsy' to provide cross-sectional images of tissue structure on the micron scale.  It is a promising imaging technol. because it can provide images of tissue in situ and in real time, without the need for excision and processing of specimens.\n",

      "Optical Coherence Tomog. (OCT) enables real-time imaging of living tissues at cell-scale resoln. over millimeters in three dimensions.  Despite these advantages, functional biol. studies with OCT have been limited by a lack of exogenous contrast agents that can be distinguished from tissue.  Here we report an approach to functional OCT imaging that implements custom algorithms to spectrally identify unique contrast agents: large gold nanorods (LGNRs).  LGNRs exhibit 110-fold greater spectral signal per particle than conventional GNRs, which enables detection of individual LGNRs in water and concns. as low as 250 pM in the circulation of living mice.  This translates to ∼40 particles per imaging voxel in vivo.  Unlike previous implementations of OCT spectral detection, the methods described herein adaptively compensate for depth and processing artifacts on a per sample basis.  Collectively, these methods enable high-quality noninvasive contrast-enhanced imaging of OCT in living subjects, including detection of tumor microvasculature at twice the depth achievable with conventional OCT.  Addnl., multiplexed detection of spectrally-distinct LGNRs was demonstrated to observe discrete patterns of lymphatic drainage and identify individual lymphangions and lymphatic valve functional states.  These capabilities provide a powerful platform for mol. imaging and characterization of tissue noninvasively at cellular resoln., called MOZART.\n",

      "Multimodal imaging with photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be an effective method to evaluate the choroidal and retinal microvasculature.  To improve the efficiency for visualizing capillaries, colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been applied as a multimodal contrast agent for both OCT and PAM imaging by taking advantage of the strong optical scattering and the strong optical absorption of AuNPs due to their surface plasmon resonance.  Ultra-pure AuNPs were fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation, capped with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and administered to 13 New Zealand white rabbits and 3 Dutch Belted pigmented rabbits.  The synthesized PEG-AuNPs (20.0 ± 1.5 nm) were demonstrated to be excellent contrast agents for PAM and OCT, and do not demonstrate cytotoxicity to bovine retinal endothelial cells in cell studies.  The image signal from the retinal and choroidal vessels in living rabbits was enhanced by up to 82% for PAM and up to 45% for OCT, respectively, by the administered PEG-AuNPs, which enables detection of individual blood vessels by both imaging modalities.  The biodistribution study demonstrated the AuNP accumulated primarily in the liver and spleen.  Histology and TUNEL staining did not indicate cell injury or death in the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, heart, or eyes up to seven days after AuNP administration.  PEG-AuNPs offer an efficient and safe contrast agent for multimodal ocular imaging to achieve improved characterization of microvasculature.\n",

      "Optical coherence tomog. angiog. (OCTA) is an important tool for investigating vascular networks and microcirculation in living tissue.  Traditional OCTA detects blood vessels via intravascular dynamic scattering signals derived from the movements of red blood cells (RBCs).  However, the low hematocrit and long latency between RBCs in capillaries make these OCTA signals discontinuous, leading to incomplete mapping of the vascular networks.  OCTA imaging of microvascular circulation is particularly challenging in tumors due to the abnormally slow blood flow in angiogenic tumor vessels and strong attenuation of light by tumor tissue.  Here, we demonstrate in vivo that gold nanoprisms (GNPRs) can be used as OCT contrast agents working in the second near-IR window, significantly enhancing the dynamic scattering signals in microvessels and improving the sensitivity of OCTA in skin tissue and melanoma tumors in live mice.  With GNPRs as contrast agents, the postinjection OCT angiograms showed 41 and 59% more microvasculature than preinjection angiograms in healthy mouse skin and melanoma tumors, resp.  By enabling better characterization of microvascular circulation in vivo, GNPR-enhanced OCTA could lead to better understanding of vascular functions during pathol. conditions, more accurate measurements of therapeutic response, and improved patient prognoses.\n",

      "Current imaging techniques capable of tracking nanoparticles in vivo supply either a large field of view or cellular resolution, but not both.  Here, we demonstrate a multimodality imaging platform of optical coherence tomography (OCT) techniques for high resolution, wide field of view in vivo imaging of nanoparticles.  This platform includes the first in vivo images of nanoparticle pharmacokinetics acquired with photothermal OCT (PTOCT), along with overlaying images of microvascular and tissue morphology.  Gold nanorods (51.8 ± 8.1 nm by 15.2 ± 3.3 nm) were intravenously injected into mice, and their accumulation into mammary tumors was non-invasively imaged in vivo in three dimensions over 24 hours using PTOCT.  Spatial frequency analysis of PTOCT images indicated that gold nanorods reached peak distribution throughout the tumors by 16 hours, and remained well-dispersed up to 24 hours post-injection.  In contrast, the overall accumulation of gold nanorods within the tumors peaked around 16 hours post-injection.  The accumulation of gold nanorods within the tumors was validated post-mortem with multiphoton microscopy.  This shows the utility of PTOCT as part of a powerful multimodality imaging platform for the development of nanomedicines and drug delivery technologies.\n",

      "Biol. soft tissues are almost transparent to hard X rays and therefore cannot be investigated without enhancement with a contrast medium, such as iodine.  On the other hand, phase-contrast X-ray imaging is eensitive to light elements1-8.  This is because the X-ray pahse shift cross section is almost a thousand times larger than the X-ray absorption cross section for ligght elements such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen4,15.  Hence, phase-contrast X-ray imaging is a promising technique for observing the structure inside biol. soft tissues without the need for staining and without serious radiation exposure.  We have devised a means of observing biol. tissues in three dimensions using a novel X-ray computed tomog. (CT) by modifying the phase-contrast technique.  To generate appropriate CT input data, we used phase-mapping images obtained using an X-ray interferometer and computer anal. of interference patterns9.  Now, we present a three-dimensional observation result of a nonstained sample of a cancerous rabbit liver, using a synchrotron X-ray source.  Phase-contrast X-ray CT was able to clearly differentiate the cancer lesion from the normal tissue.  Moreover, fine structures corresponding to cancerous degeneration and fibrous tissues were clearly depicted.\n",

      "A review.  Semiconductor nanowires offer new opportunities for optoelectronic and spintronic nanodevices.  However, their full potential is ultimately dictated by our ability to control multiple property-function relationships taking place at the nanoscale in the spatial and time domains.  Only a combination of high-resoln. anal. techniques can provide a comprehensive understanding of their complex functionalities.  Here we describe how a multimodal hard X-ray nanoprobe addresses fundamental questions in nanowire research.  Selected topics ranging from cluster formation, dopant segregation, and phase sepns. to quantum confinement effects are investigated with sub-100 nm spatial resoln. and sub-50 ps temporal resoln.  This approach opens new avenues for structural, compn. and optical studies with broad applicability in materials science.\n",

      "A review.  To better understand the physiol. and acclimation capability of the cell, one of the great challenges of the future is to access the interior of a cell and unveil its chem. landscape (compn. and distribution of elements and mols.).  Chem. imaging has greatly improved in sensitivity and spatial resoln. to visualize and quantify nutrients, metabolites, toxic elements, and drugs in single cells at the subcellular level.  This review aims to present the current potential of these emerging imaging technologies and to guide biologists toward a strategy for interrogating biol. processes at the nanoscale.  We also describe various solns. to combine multiple imaging techniques in a correlative way and provide perspectives and future directions for integrative subcellular imaging across different disciplines.\n",

      "A review.  Over the past few decades, material scientists have developed a wide variety of approaches to deliberately introduce chem. and structural inhomogeneities into nanoparticles, achieving for example intentional doping, concn. gradients, and multicomponent structures.  This perspective presents a sense of how modern hard X-ray spectroscopic methods, far from merely providing new tools, are extending the way we study and understand such complex nanoparticles.  Particularly, the possibility to select with high resoln. the incident and emission hard X-ray energies offers unprecedented site selectivity, and rapid data acquisition helps to uncover the complex chem. world behind the state-of-the-art synthetic methods like hot-injection, Brust-Schiffrin, supercrit.-flow, and nonaq. synthesis.  Therefore, today the in situ spectroscopic studies provide a new view into the genesis of heterogeneity in colloidal nanoparticles.\n",

      "The use of XANES spectroscopy, both in classical and in dispersive geometries, is illustrated for the study of copper-based catalysts under in situ or in operando conditions.  As case studies, copper-exchanged MFI zeolites and CuCl2/γ-Al2O3 systems are considered.  In the former case, in situ XANES spectroscopy was used to characterize well defined complexes (Cu+N2, Cu+(CO)3, Cu+(NH3)(CO) and Cu+(NO)2) formed on copper ions inside the zeolite cavities under controlled conditions.  From these results, useful information concerning the symmetry of the formed complexes can readily be gained.  The latter case shows how the use of dispersive XANES spectroscopy allows to follow, in real time, the evolution of a system in working conditions.  The simultaneous detn. of the catalyst activity and of the av. oxidn. state of copper in the catalyst allows the evolution of a system in working conditions to be followed in real time.  The criteria used for the quantification of the Cu(I) and Cu(II) fraction from XANES spectra are discussed in detail.\n",

      "A review.  Cells and biol. materials are large objects in comparison to the size of internal components such as organelles and proteins.  An understanding of the functions of these nanoscale elements is key to elucidating cellular function.  In this review, the authors describe the advances in x-ray scattering and diffraction techniques for imaging biol. systems at the nanoscale.  The authors present a no. of principal technol. advances in x-ray optics and development of sample environments.  The authors identify radiation damage as one of the most severe challenges in the field, thus rendering the dose an important parameter when putting different x-ray methods in perspective.  Furthermore, the authors describe different successful approaches, including scanning and full-field techniques, along with prominent examples.  Finally, the authors present a few recent studies that combined several techniques in one expt. to collect highly complementary data for a multidimensional sample characterization.\n",

      "In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to X-ray phase contrast imaging, since it can provide high-contrast images by using phase variations.  Among the different existing techniques, Zernike phase contrast microscopy is one of the most popular phase-sensitive techniques for investigating the fine structure of the sample at high spatial resoln.  In X-ray Zernike phase contrast microscopy, the image contrast is indeed a mixt. of absorption and phase contrast.  Therefore, this technique just provides qual. information on the object, which makes the interpretation of the image difficult.  In this contribution, an approach is proposed for quant. phase retrieval in X-ray Zernike phase contrast microscopy.  By shifting the phase of the direct light by π/2 and 3π/2, two images of the same object are measured successively.  The phase information of the object can then be quant. retrieved by a proper combination of the measured images.  Numerical expts. were carried out and the results confirmed the feasibility of the proposed method.  It is expected that the proposed method will find widespread applications in biol., materials science and so on.\n",

      "Full-field transmission hard X-ray microscopy (TXM) has been widely applied to study morphology and structures with high spatial precision and to dynamic processes.  Zernike phase contrast (ZPC) in hard X-ray TXM is often utilized to get an in-line phase contrast enhancement for weak-absorbing materials with little contrast differences.  Here, following forward image formation, we derive and simplify the contrast transfer functions (CTFs) of the Zernike phase imaging system in TXM based on a linear space-shift-invariant imaging mode under certain approximations.  The CTFs in ZPC in their simplified forms show a high similarity to the one in free-space propagation X-ray imaging systems.\n",

      "Using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy the authors have measured the rotational modes of concd. charged gibbsite platelets in the isotropic regime.  This was done by analyzing the data qual. using available theories for noninteracting systems.  The relaxation spectra do not follow the same pattern as for spherical particles at larger wave vectors.  This deviation from the behavior of spherical systems arises from the influence of the rotational modes.  In the isotropic state a pre-transitional peak in the static q-dependent intensity at large q values is discussed.  Probably this peak originates from a strong local alignment between platelets before the actual phase transition takes place.  (c) 2013 American Institute of Physics.\n",

      "Structural distortion and relaxation are central to any liq. flow.  Their full understanding requires simultaneous probing of the mech. as well as structural and dynamical response.  We provide the first full dynamical measurement of the transient structure using combined coherent X-ray scattering and rheol. on electrostatically interacting colloidal fluids.  We find a stress overshoot during the start-up of shear which is due to the strong anisotropic overstretching and compression of nearest-neighbor distances.  The rheol. response is reflected in uncorrelated entropy-driven intensity fluctuations.  While the structural distortion under steady shear is well described by Smoluchowski theory, we find an increase of the particle dynamics beyond the trivial contribution of flow.  After the cessation of shear, the full fluid microstructure and dynamics are restored, both on the structural relaxation timescale.  We thus find unique structure-dynamics relations in liq. flow, responsible for the macroscopic rheol. behavior of the system.\n",

      "Nanostructures have attracted huge interest as a rapidly growing class of materials for many applications.  Several techniques have been used to characterize the size, crystal structure, elemental compn. and a variety of other phys. properties of nanoparticles.  In several cases, there are phys. properties that can be evaluated by more than one technique.  Different strengths and limitations of each technique complicate the choice of the most suitable method, while often a combinatorial characterization approach is needed.  In addn., given that the significance of nanoparticles in basic research and applications is constantly increasing, it is necessary that researchers from sep. fields overcome the challenges in the reproducible and reliable characterization of nanomaterials, after their synthesis and further process (e.g. annealing) stages.  The principal objective of this review is to summarize the present knowledge on the use, advances, advantages and weaknesses of a large no. of exptl. techniques that are available for the characterization of nanoparticles.  Different characterization techniques are classified according to the concept/group of the technique used, the information they can provide, or the materials that they are destined for.  We describe the main characteristics of the techniques and their operation principles and we give various examples of their use, presenting them in a comparative mode, when possible, in relation to the property studied in each case.\n",

      "Abstr.: Nonlamellar lipid-based liq. cryst. (LLC) nanoparticles possessing different internal nanostructures, specifically the 3D-ordered cubosomes (V2 phase) and the 2D-ordered hexosomes (H2 phase), are of increasing interest as drug delivery systems.  To facilitate their development, it is important that we understand their interactions with healthy human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).  To this end, a 3D cells-in-a-tube model that recapitulates the basic morphol. (i.e. tubular lumen) and in vivo microenvironment (i.e. physiol. shear stress) of blood vessels was employed as a biomimetic testing platform, and the bio-nanoparticle interactions were compared with that of the conventional 2D planar cell culture.  Confocal microscopy imaging revealed internalisation of the nanoparticles into HUVECs within 2 h and that the nanoparticle-cell interactions of cubosomes and hexosomes were not significantly different from one another.  Low fluid shear stress conditions (i.e. venous simulation at 0.8 dynes/cm2) were shown to impose subtle effects on the degree of nanoparticle-cell interactions as compared with the static 2D culture.  The unexpected similarity of cellular interactions between cubosomes and hexosomes was clarified via a real-time phase behavior anal. using the synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique.  When the nanoparticles came into contact with HUVECs under circulating conditions, the cubosomes gradually evolved into hexosomes (within 16 min).  In contrast, the hexosomes retained their original internal structure with minimal changes to the lattice parameters.  This study highlights the need to couple cellular studies with high-resoln. analytics such as time-resolved SAXS anal. to ensure that particle structures are verified in situ, enabling accurate interpretation of the dynamics of cellular interactions and potential bio-induced changes of particles intended for biomedical applications.

      "Micro-beam x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was used to investigate rutile TiO2 nanoparticles internalized into gastrointestinal cells during their crossing of a gut model barrier.  Nanoparticles dild. in culture medium tend to accumulate in cells after 48 h exposure; however, no spectral differences arise between particles in cellular and in acellular environments, as corroborated by quant. anal.  This finding establishes that no modification of the lattice properties of the nanoparticles occurs upon interaction with the barrier.  These measurements demonstrate the possibility of interrogating nanoparticles in situ within cells, suggesting a way to investigate their fate when incorporated in biol. hosts.

      "Although the current prodn. of oxide nanoparticles may be modest, the wide range of proposed applications and forecasted growth in prodn. has raised questions about the potential impact of these nanoparticles on the environment and human health.  Iron oxide nanoparticles have been proposed for an increasing no. of biomedical applications although in vitro toxicity depending on the particles coating has been evidenced.  The aim of this study was to examine the potential in vitro cyto- and genotoxicity on human dermal fibroblasts of DMSA-coated maghemite nanoparticles (NmDMSA) as a function of well-defined physicochem. states.  Well-stabilized NmDMSA produced weak cytotoxic and no genotoxic effects.  This is attributed in part to the DMSA coating, which serves as a barrier for a direct contact between nano-oxide and fibroblasts, inhibiting a potential toxic effect.\n",

      "Within the framework of the ESRF Phase I Upgrade Program, a new state-of-the-art synchrotron beamline ID16B has been recently developed for hard X-ray nano-anal.  The construction of ID16B was driven by research areas with major scientific and societal impact such as nanotechnol., earth and environmental sciences, and bio-medical research.  Based on a canted undulator source, this long beamline provides hard X-ray nanobeams optimized mainly for spectroscopic applications, including the combination of X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, X-ray excited optical luminescence, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and 2D/3D X-ray imaging techniques.  Its end-station re-uses part of the app. of the earlier ID22 beamline, while improving and enlarging the spectroscopic capabilities: for example, the exptl. arrangement offers improved lateral spatial resoln. (∼50 nm), a larger and more flexible capability for in situ expts., and monochromatic nanobeams tunable over a wider energy range which now includes the hard X-ray regime (5-70 keV).  This paper describes the characteristics of this new facility, short-term tech. developments and the first scientific results.\n",

It supports X-ray fluorescence and (coherent) diffraction contrast, yielding elemental and structural information from inside the sample.  Spatial resolns. down to well below 50 nm are aimed for in direct space.  A further increase in spatial resoln. is expected by applying ptychog. scanning schemes.  The optical scheme with a two-stage focusing optic is described.\n",

      "The MISTRAL beamline is one of the seven phase-I beamlines at the ALBA synchrotron light source (Barcelona, Spain) that will be opened to users at the end of 2010.  MISTRAL will be devoted to cryotomography in the water window and multi-keV spectral regions for biological applications.  The optics design consists of a plane-grating monochromator that has been implemented using variable-line-spacing gratings to fulfil the requirements of X-ray microscopy using a reflective condenser.  For instance, a fixed-focus condition independent of the included angle, constant magnification as well as coma and spherical aberration corrections are achieved with this system.

      "The Nanoscopium 155 m-long beamline of Synchrotron Soleil is dedicated to scanning hard X-ray nanoprobe techniques.  Nanoscopium aims to reach ≤100 nm resoln. in the 5-20 keV energy range for routine user expts.  The beamline design tackles the tight stability requirements of such a scanning nanoprobe by creating an overfilled secondary source, implementing all horizontally reflecting main beamline optics, applying high mech. stability equipment and constructing a dedicated high-stability building envelope.  Multi-technique scanning imaging and tomog. including X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and spectro-microscopy, absorption, differential phase and dark-field contrasts are implemented at the beamline in order to provide simultaneous information on the elemental distribution, speciation and sample morphol.  This paper describes the optical concept and the first measured performance of the Nanoscopium beamline followed by the hierarchical length-scale multi-technique imaging expts. performed with dwell times down to 3 ms per pixel.\n",

      "Functionalized computed tomog. (CT) in combination with labeled cells is virtually non-existent due to the limited sensitivity of X-ray-absorption-based imaging, but would be highly desirable to realize cell tracking studies in entire organisms.  In this study we applied in-line free propagation X-ray phase-contrast CT (XPCT) in an allergic asthma mouse model to assess structural changes as well as the biodistribution of barium-labeled macrophages in lung tissue.  Alveolar macrophages that were barium-sulfate-loaded and fluorescent-labeled were instilled intratracheally into asthmatic and control mice.  Mice were sacrificed after 24 h, lungs were kept in situ, inflated with air and scanned utilizing XPCT at the SYRMEP beamline (Elettra Synchrotron Light Source, Italy).  Single-distance phase retrieval was used to generate data sets with ten times greater contrast-to-noise ratio than absorption-based CT (in our setup), thus allowing to depict and quantify structural hallmarks of asthmatic lungs such as reduced air vol., obstruction of airways and increased soft-tissue content.  Furthermore, we found a higher concn. as well as a specific accumulation of the barium-labeled macrophages in asthmatic lung tissue.  It is believe that XPCT will be beneficial in preclin. asthma research for both the assessment of therapeutic response as well as the anal. of the role of the recruitment of macrophages to inflammatory sites.\n",

      "Background: Angiogenesis is widely investigated in conjunction with cancer development, in particular because of the possibility of early stage detection and of new therapeutic strategies.  However, such studies are neg. affected by the limitations of imaging techniques in the detection of microscopic blood vessels (diam. 3-5 μm) grown under angiogenic stress.  We report that synchrotron-based X-ray imaging techniques with very high spatial resoln. can overcome this obstacle, provided that suitable contrast agents are used.  Results: We tested different contrast agents based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for the detection of cancer-related angiogenesis by synchrotron microradiol., microtomog. and high resoln. X-ray microscopy.  Among them only bare-AuNPs in conjunction with heparin injection provided sufficient contrast to allow in vivo detection of small capillary species (the smallest measured lumen diams. were 3-5 μm).  The detected vessel d. was 3-7 times higher than with other nanoparticles.  We also found that bare-AuNPs with heparin allows detecting symptoms of local extravascular nanoparticle diffusion in tumor areas where capillary leakage appeared.  Conclusions: Although high-Z AuNPs are natural candidates as radiol. contrast agents, their success is not guaranteed, in particular when targeting very small blood vessels in tumor-related angiog.  We found that AuNPs injected with heparin produced the contrast level needed to reveal-for the first time by X-ray imaging-tumor microvessels with 3-5 μm diam. as well as extravascular diffusion due to basal membrane defenestration.  These results open the interesting possibility of functional imaging of the tumor microvasculature, of its development and organization, as well as of the effects of anti-angiogenic drugs.\n",

      "A review.  Morphometric measurements, such as quantifying cell shape, characterizing sub-cellular organization, and probing cell-cell interactions, are fundamental in cell biol. and clin. medicine.  Until quite recently, the main source of morphometric data on cells has been light-and electron-based microscope images.  However, many technol. advances have propelled X-ray microscopy into becoming another source of high-quality morphometric information.  Here, we review the status of X-ray microscopy as a quant. biol. imaging modality.  We also describe the combination of X-ray microscopy data with information from other modalities to generate polychromatic views of biol. systems.  For example, the amalgamation of mol. localization data, from fluorescence microscopy or spectromicroscopy, with structural information from X-ray tomog.  This combination of data from the same specimen generates a more complete picture of the system than that can be obtained by a single microscopy method.  Such multimodal combinations greatly enhance our understanding of biol. by combining physiol. and morphol. data to create models that more accurately reflect the complexities of life.\n",

      "An app. for sub-nanosecond time-resolved ambient-pressure XPS studies with pulsed and const. wave x-ray light sources is presented.  A differentially pumped hemispherical electron analyzer is equipped with a delay-line detector that simultaneously records the position and arrival time of every single electron at the exit aperture of the hemisphere with ∼0.1 mm spatial resoln. and ∼150 ps temporal accuracy.  The kinetic energies of the photoelectrons are encoded in the hit positions along the dispersive axis of the 2-dimensional detector.  Pump-probe time-delays are provided by the electron arrival times relative to the pump pulse timing.  An av. time-resoln. of (780±20) ps (FWHM) is demonstrated for a hemisphere pass energy Ep = 150 eV and an electron kinetic energy range KE = 503-508 eV.  The time-resoln. of the setup is limited by the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spread related to the electron trajectory distribution within the analyzer hemisphere and within the electrostatic lens system that images the interaction vol. onto the hemisphere entrance slit.  The TOF spread for electrons with KE = 430 eV varies between ∼9 ns at a pass energy of 50 eV and ∼1 ns at pass energies between 200 eV and 400 eV.  The correlation between the retarding ratio and the TOF spread is evaluated by means of both anal. descriptions of the electron trajectories within the analyzer hemisphere and computer simulations of the entire trajectories including the electrostatic lens system.  In agreement with previous studies, the authors find that the by far dominant contribution to the TOF spread is acquired within the hemisphere.  However, both expt. and computer simulations show that the lens system indirectly affects the time resoln. of the setup to a significant extent by inducing a strong dependence of the angular spread of electron trajectories entering the hemisphere on the retarding ratio.  The scaling of the angular spread with the retarding ratio can be well approximated by applying Liouville's theorem of const. emittance to the electron trajectories inside the lens system.  The performance of the setup is demonstrated by characterizing the laser fluence-dependent transient surface photovoltage response of a laser-excited Si(100) sample.

      "We present a picosecond time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (tr-XAS) setup designed for synchrotron-based studies of interfacial photochem. dynamics.  The app. combines a high power, variable repetition rate picosecond laser system with a time-resolved X-ray fluorescence yield detection technique.  Time-tagging of the detected fluorescence signals enables the parallel acquisition of X-ray absorption spectra at a variety of pump-probe delays employing the well-defined time structure of the X-ray pulse trains.  The viability of the setup is demonstrated by resolving dynamic changes in the fine structure near the O1s X-ray absorption edge of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) after photo-excitation with a 355 nm laser pulse.  Two distinct responses are detected.  A pronounced, quasi-static, reversible change of the Cu2O O1s X-ray absorption spectrum by up to ∼30% compared to its static line shape corresponds to a red shift of the absorption edge by ∼1 eV.  This value is small compared to the 2.2 eV band gap of Cu2O but in agreement with previously published results.  The lifetime of this effect exceeds the laser pulse-to-pulse period of 8μs, resulting in a quasi-static spectral change that persists as long as the sample is exposed to the laser light, and completely vanishes once the laser is blocked.  Addnl., a short-lived response corresponding to a laser-induced shift of the main absorption line by ∼2 eV to lower energies appears within <200 ps and decays with a characteristic timescale of 43 ± 5 ns.  Both the picosecond rise and nanosecond decay of this X-ray response are simultaneously captured by making use of a time-tagging approach - highlighting the prospects of the exptl. setup for efficient probing of the electronic and structural dynamics in photocatalytic systems on multiple timescales.\n",

      "The Adaptive Gain Integrating Pixel Detector (AGIPD) is an X-ray imager, custom designed for the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL).  It is a fast, low-noise integrating detector, with an adaptive gain amplifier per pixel.  This has an equiv. noise of less than 1 keV when detecting single photons and, when switched into another gain state, a dynamic range of more than 104 photons of 12 keV.  In burst mode the system is able to store 352 images while running at up to 6.5 MHz, which is compatible with the 4.5 MHz frame rate at the European XFEL.  The AGIPD system was installed and commissioned in August 2017, and successfully used for the first expts. at the Single Particles, Clusters and Biomols. (SPB) exptl. station at the European XFEL since Sept. 2017.  This paper describes the principal components and performance parameters of the system.\n",

      "We have examd. the formation and dissoln. of gels composed of intermediate vol.-fraction nanoparticles with temp.-dependent short-range attractions using small-angle x-ray scattering, x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, and rheol. to obtain nanoscale and macroscale sensitivity to structure and dynamics.  Gel formation after temp. quenches to the vicinity of the rheol. detd. gel temp., Tgel, was characterized via the slowdown of dynamics and changes in microstructure obsd. in the intensity autocorrelation functions and structure factor, resp., as a function of quench depth (ΔT = Tquench - Tgel), wave vector, and formation time tf.  We find the wave-vector-dependent dynamics, microstructure, and rheol. at a particular ΔT and tf map to those at other ΔTs and tfs via an effective scaling temp., Ts.  A single Ts applies to a broad range of ΔT and tf but does depend on the particle size.  The rate of formation implied by the scaling is a far stronger function of ΔT than expected from the attraction strength between colloids.  We interpret this strong temp. dependence in terms of cooperative bonding required to form stable gels via energetically favored, local structures.\n",

      "The entatic state denotes a distorted coordination geometry of a complex from its typical arrangement that generates an improvement to its function.  The entatic-state principle has been obsd. to apply to copper electron-transfer proteins and it results in a lowering of the reorganization energy of the electron-transfer process.  It is thus crucial for a multitude of biochem. processes, but its importance to photoactive complexes is unexplored.  Here we study a copper complex-with a specifically designed constraining ligand geometry-that exhibits metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state lifetimes that are very short.  The guanidine-quinoline ligand used here acts on the bis(chelated) copper(I) center, allowing only small structural changes after photoexcitation that result in very fast structural dynamics.  The data were collected using a multimethod approach that featured time-resolved UV-visible, IR and X-ray absorption and optical emission spectroscopy.  Through supporting d. functional calcns., we deliver a detailed picture of the structural dynamics in the picosecond-to-nanosecond time range.\n",

      "Precise localization of nanoparticles within a cell is crucial to the understanding of cell-particle interactions and has broad applications in nanomedicine.  Here, we report a proof-of-principle experiment for imaging individual functionalized nanoparticles within a mammalian cell by correlative microscopy.  Using a chemically-fixed HeLa cell labeled with fluorescent core-shell nanoparticles as a model system, we implemented a graphene-oxide layer as a substrate to significantly reduce background scattering.  We identified cellular features of interest by fluorescence microscopy, followed by scanning transmission X-ray tomography to localize the particles in 3D, and ptychographic coherent diffractive imaging of the fine features in the region at high resolution.  By tuning the X-ray energy to the Fe L-edge, we demonstrated sensitive detection of nanoparticles composed of a 22 nm magnetic Fe3O4 core encased by a 25-nm-thick fluorescent silica (SiO2) shell.  These fluorescent core-shell nanoparticles act as landmarks and offer clarity in a cellular context.  Our correlative microscopy results confirmed a subset of particles to be fully internalized, and high-contrast ptychographic images showed two oxidation states of individual nanoparticles with a resolution of ~16.5 nm.  The ability to precisely localize individual fluorescent nanoparticles within mammalian cells will expand our understanding of the structure/function relationships for functionalized nanoparticles.\n",

      "A selective method is proposed for the detn. of palladium, gold, and sulfur in catalytic systems, by direct liq. anal. using energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF), under an atm. of helium or air.  This method allows a nondestructive anal. of palladium, rhodium, platinum, and gold nanoparticulate catalysts stabilized by imidazolium propane sulfonate based zwitterionic surfactants, allowing the samples to be reused for catalytic studies.  The signals from palladium, rhodium, platinum, and gold samples in the presence of imidazolium propane sulfonate-based zwitterionic surfactants obtained using EDXRF before (Pd2+, Rh2+, Pt2+, and Au3+) and after (Pd0, Rh0, Pt0, and Au0) formation of nanoparticles are essentially identical.  The EDXRF method is nondestructive and allows detection and quantification of the main components of platinum, gold, rhodium, and palladium NPs, including the surfactant concn., with detection and quantification limits at 0.4-3 mg L-1.  The matrixes used in such samples present no problems, even allowing the detection and quantification of interfering elements.\n",

      "Selenocompounds (SeCs) are promising therapeutic agents for a wide range of diseases including cancer.  The treatment results are heterogeneous and dependent on both the chem. species and the concn. of SeCs.  Moreover, the mechanisms of action are poorly revealed, which most probably is due to the detection methods where the quantification is based on the total selenium as an element.  To understand the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneous cytotoxicity of SeCs and to det. their pharmacokinetics, we investigated selenium speciation of six SeCs representing different categories using liq. chromatog.-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and the cytotoxicity using leukemic cells.  SeCs cytotoxicity was correlated with albumin binding degree as revealed by LC-MS and XAS.  Further anal. corroborated the covalent binding between selenol intermediates of SeCs and albumin thiols.  On basis of the Se-S model, pharmacokinetic properties of four SeCs were for the first time profiled.  In summary, we have shown that cytotoxic SeCs could spontaneously transform into selenol intermediates that immediately react with albumin thiols through Se-S bond.  The heterogeneous albumin binding degree may predict the variability in cytotoxicity.  The present knowledge will also guide further kinetic and mechanistic investigations in both exptl. and clin. settings.\n",

      "X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) is a powerful element-selective tool to analyze the oxidn. states of atoms in complex compds., det. their electronic configuration, and identify unknown compds. in challenging environments.  Until now the low efficiency of wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometer technol. has limited the use of XES, esp. in combination with weaker lab. X-ray sources.  More efficient energy-dispersive detectors have either insufficient energy resoln. because of the statistical limits described by Fano or too low counting rates to be of practical use.  This paper updates an approach to high-resoln. X-ray emission spectroscopy that uses a microcalorimeter detector array of superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs).  TES arrays are discussed and compared with conventional methods, and shown under which circumstances they are superior.  It is also shown that a TES array can be integrated into a table-top time-resolved X-ray source and a soft X-ray synchrotron beamline to perform emission spectroscopy with good chem. sensitivity over a very wide range of energies.\n",

      "A review.  We describe a series of microcalorimeter X-ray spectrometers designed for a broad suite of measurement applications.  The chief advantage of this type of spectrometer is that it can be orders of magnitude more efficient at collecting X-rays than more traditional high-resoln. spectrometers that rely on wavelength-dispersive techniques.  This advantage is most useful in applications that are traditionally photon-starved and/or involve radiation-sensitive samples.  Each energy-dispersive spectrometer is built around an array of several hundred transition-edge sensors (TESs).  TESs are superconducting thin films that are biased into their superconducting-to-normal-metal transitions.  The spectrometers share a common readout architecture and many design elements, such as a compact, 65 mK detector package, 8-column time-division-multiplexed superconducting quantum-interference device readout, and a liq.-cryogen-free cryogenic system that is a two-stage adiabatic-demagnetization refrigerator backed by a pulse-tube cryocooler.  We have adapted this flexible architecture to mate to a variety of sample chambers and measurement systems that encompass a range of observing geometries.  There are two different types of TES pixels employed.  The first, designed for X-ray energies below 10 keV, has a best demonstrated energy resoln. of 2.1 eV (full-width-at-half-max. or FWHM) at 5.9 keV.  The second, designed for X-ray energies below 2 keV, has a best demonstrated resoln. of 1.0 eV (FWHM) at 500 eV.  Our team has now deployed seven of these X-ray spectrometers to a variety of light sources, accelerator facilities, and lab.-scale expts.; these seven spectrometers have already performed measurements related to their applications.  Another five of these spectrometers will come online in the near future.  We have applied our TES spectrometers to the following measurement applications: synchrotron-based absorption and emission spectroscopy and energy-resolved scattering; accelerator-based spectroscopy of hadronic atoms and particle-induced-emission spectroscopy; lab.-based time-resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy with a tabletop, broadband source; and lab.-based metrol. of X-ray-emission lines.  Here, we discuss the design, construction, and operation of our TES spectrometers and show first-light measurements from the various systems.  Finally, because X-ray-TES technol. continues to mature, we discuss improvements to array size, energy resoln., and counting speed that we anticipate in our next generation of TES-X-ray spectrometers and beyond.

      "An ambitious goal in biol. is to understand the behavior of cells during development by imaging-in vivo and with subcellular resoln.-changes of the embryonic structure.  Important morphogenetic movements occur throughout embryogenesis, but in particular during gastrulation when a series of dramatic, coordinated cell movements drives the reorganization of a simple ball or sheet of cells into a complex multi-layered organism.  In Xenopus laevis, the South African clawed frog and also in zebrafish, cell and tissue movements have been studied in explants, in fixed embryos, in vivo using fluorescence microscopy or microscopic magnetic resonance imaging.  None of these methods allows cell behaviors to be obsd. with micrometer-scale resoln. throughout the optically opaque, living embryo over developmental time.  Here we use non-invasive in vivo, time-lapse X-ray microtomog., based on single-distance phase contrast and combined with motion anal., to examine the course of embryonic development.  We demonstrate that this powerful 4-dimensional imaging technique provides high-resoln. views of gastrulation processes in wild-type X. laevis embryos, including vegetal endoderm rotation, archenteron formation, changes in the vols. of cavities within the porous interstitial tissue between archenteron and blastocoel, migration/confrontation of mesendoderm, and closure of the blastopore.  Differential flow anal. separates collective from relative cell motion to assign propulsion mechanisms.  Moreover, digitally detd. vol. balances confirm that early archenteron inflation occurs through the uptake of external water.  A transient ectodermal ridge, formed in assocn. with the confrontation of ventral and head mesendoderm on the blastocoel roof, is identified.  When combined with perturbation expts. to investigate mol. and biomech. underpinnings of morphogenesis, our technique should help to advance our understanding of the fundamentals of development.\n",

      "X-ray phase-contrast microtomog. (XPCμT) is a label-free, high-resoln. imaging modality for analyzing early development of vertebrate embryos in vivo by using time-lapse sequences of 3D vols.  Here we provide a detailed protocol for applying this technique to study gastrulation in Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) embryos.  In contrast to μMRI, XPCμT images optically opaque embryos with subminute temporal and micrometer-range spatial resoln.  We describe sample prepn., culture and suspension of embryos, tomog. imaging with a typical duration of 2 h (gastrulation and neurulation stages), intricacies of image pre-processing, phase retrieval, tomog. reconstruction, segmentation and motion anal.  Moreover, we briefly discuss our present understanding of X-ray dose effects (heat load and radiolysis), and we outline how to optimize the exptl. configuration with respect to X-ray energy, photon flux d., sample-detector distance, exposure time per tomog. projection, nos. of projections and time-lapse intervals.  The protocol requires an interdisciplinary effort of developmental biologists for sample prepn. and data interpretation, X-ray physicists for planning and performing the expt. and applied mathematicians/computer scientists/physicists for data processing and anal.  Sample prepn. requires 9-48 h, depending on the stage of development to be studied.  Data acquisition takes 2-3 h per tomog. time-lapse sequence.  Data processing and anal. requires a further 2 wk, depending on the availability of computing power and the amt. of detail required to address a given scientific problem.\n",

      "A review.  X-rays have been used for non-invasive high-resoln. imaging of thick biol. specimens since their discovery in 1895.  They are widely used for structural imaging of bone, metal implants, and cavities in soft tissue.  Recently, a no. of new contrast methodologies have emerged which are expanding X-ray's biomedical applications to functional as well as structural imaging.  These techniques are promising to dramatically improve our ability to study in situ biochem. and disease pathol.  In this review, we discuss how X-ray absorption, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray excited optical luminescence can be used for physiol., elemental, and mol. imaging of vasculature, tumors, pharmaceutical distribution, and the surface of implants.  Imaging of endogenous elements, exogenous labels, and analytes detected with optical indicators will be discussed.\n",

      "We report super-resoln. fluorescence imaging of live cells with high spatiotemporal resoln. using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM).  By labeling proteins either directly or via SNAP tags with photoswitchable dyes, we obtained two-dimensional (2D) and 3D super-resoln. images of living cells, using clathrin-coated pits and the transferrin cargo as model systems.  Bright, fast-switching probes enabled us to achieve 2D imaging at spatial resolns. of ∼25 nm and temporal resolns. as fast as 0.5 s.  We also demonstrated live-cell 3D super-resoln. imaging.  We obtained 3D spatial resoln. of ∼30 nm in the lateral direction and ∼50 nm in the axial direction at time resolns. as fast as 1-2 s with several independent snapshots.  Using photoswitchable dyes with distinct emission wavelengths, we also demonstrated two-color 3D super-resoln. imaging in live cells.  These imaging capabilities open a new window for characterizing cellular structures in living cells at the ultrastructural level.\n",

      "A review.  Fluorescence nanoscopy uniquely combines minimally invasive optical access to the internal nanoscale structure and dynamics of cells and tissues with mol. detection specificity.  While the basic phys. principles of 'super-resoln.' imaging were discovered in the 1990s, with initial exptl. demonstrations following in 2000, the broad application of super-resoln. imaging to address cell-biol. questions has only more recently emerged.  Nanoscopy approaches have begun to facilitate discoveries in cell biol. and to add new knowledge.  One current direction for method improvement is the ambition to quant. account for each mol. under investigation and assess true mol. colocalization patterns via multi-color analyses.  In pursuing this goal, the labeling of individual mols. to enable their visualization has emerged as a central challenge.  Extending nanoscale imaging into (sliced) tissue and whole-animal contexts is a further goal.  In this Review we describe the successes to date and discuss current obstacles and possibilities for further development.\n",

      "Recent advances in fluorescence super-resoln. microscopy have allowed subcellular features and synthetic nanostructures down to 10-20 nm in size to be imaged.  However, the direct optical observation of individual mol. targets (∼5 nm) in a densely packed biomol. cluster remains a challenge.  Here, we show that such discrete mol. imaging is possible using DNA-PAINT (points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topog.)-a super-resoln. fluorescence microscopy technique that exploits programmable transient oligonucleotide hybridization-on synthetic DNA nanostructures.  We examd. the effects of a high photon count, high blinking statistics and an appropriate blinking duty cycle on imaging quality, and developed a software-based drift correction method that achieves <1 nm residual drift (root mean squared) over hours.  This allowed us to image a densely packed triangular lattice pattern with ∼5 nm point-to-point distance and to analyze the DNA origami structural offset with angstrom-level precision (2 Å) from single-mol. studies.  By combining the approach with multiplexed exchange-PAINT imaging, we further demonstrated an optical nanodisplay with 5 × 5 nm pixel size and three distinct colors with <1 nm cross-channel registration accuracy.\n",

      "Advances in microscopy techniques based on x-rays have opened unprecedented opportunities in terms of spatial resoln., combined with chem. and morphol. sensitivity, to analyze solid, soft and liq. matter.  The advent of ultrabright third and fourth generation photon sources and the continuous development of x-ray optics and detectors has pushed the limits of imaging and spectroscopic anal. to structures as small as a few tens of nanometers.  Specific interactions of x-rays with matter provide elemental and chem. sensitivity that have made x-ray spectromicroscopy techniques a very attractive tool, complementary to other microscopies, for characterization in all actual research fields.  The x-ray penetration power meets the demand to examine samples too thick for electron microscopes implementing 3D imaging and recently also 4D imaging which adds time resoln. as well.  Implementation of a variety of phase contrast techniques enhances the structural sensitivity, esp. for the hard x-ray regime.  Implementation of lensless or diffraction imaging helps to enhance the lateral resoln. of x-ray imaging to the wavelength dependent diffraction limit.\n",

      "A review.  X-ray crystallog. has been central to the development of many fields of science over the past century.  It has now matured to a point that as long as good-quality crystals are available, their at. structure can be routinely detd. in three dimensions.  However, many samples in physics, chem., materials science, nanoscience, geol., and biol. are noncryst., and thus their three-dimensional structures are not accessible by traditional x-ray crystallog.  Overcoming this hurdle has required the development of new coherent imaging methods to harness new coherent x-ray light sources.  Here we review the revolutionary advances that are transforming x-ray sources and imaging in the 21st century.\n",

      "Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent agent of human malaria, undergoes both asexual cycling and sexual differentiation inside erythrocytes.  As the intraerythrocytic parasite develops it increases in size and alters the permeability of the host cell plasma membrane.  An intriguing question is: how is the integrity of the host erythrocyte maintained during the intraerythrocytic cycle? We have used water window cryo X-ray tomography to determine cell morphology and hemoglobin content at different stages of asexual and sexual differentiation.  The cryo stabilization preserves native structure permitting accurate analyses of parasite and host cell volumes.  Absorption of soft X-rays by protein adheres to Beer-Lambert's law permitting quantitation of the concentration of hemoglobin in the host cell compartment.  During asexual development the volume of the parasite reaches about 50% of the uninfected erythrocyte volume but the infected erythrocyte volume remains relatively constant.  The total hemoglobin content gradually decreases during the 48h cycle but its concentration remains constant until early trophozoite stage, decreases by 25%, then remains constant again until just prior to rupture.  During early sexual development the gametocyte has a similar morphology to a trophozoite but then undergoes a dramatic shape change.  Our cryo X-ray tomography analysis reveals that about 70% of the host cell hemoglobin is taken up and digested during gametocyte development and the parasite eventually occupies about 50% of the uninfected erythrocyte volume.  The total volume of the infected erythrocyte remains constant, apart from some reversible shrinkage at stage IV, while the concentration of hemoglobin decreases to about 70% of that in an uninfected erythrocyte.\n",

      "Cellular structures of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were examd. by using hard X-ray tomog.  Since cells are nearly transparent to hard X-rays, Zernike phase contrast and heavy metal staining were introduced to improve image contrast.  Through using such methods, images taken at 8 keV displayed sufficient contrast for observing cellular structures.  The cell wall, the intracellular organelles and the entire structural organization of the whole cells were visualized in three-dimensional at a resoln. better than 100 nm.  Comparison between phase contrast and absorption contrast was also made, indicating the obvious advantage of phase contrast for cellular imaging at this energy.  Our results demonstrate that hard X-ray tomog. with Zernike phase contrast is suitable for cellular imaging.  Its unique abilities make it have potential to become a useful tool for revealing structural information from cells, esp. thick eukaryotic cells.\n",

      "Polyhydroxylated fullerenols esp. gadolinium endohedral metallofullerenols (Gd@C82(OH)22) are shown as a promising agent for antitumor chemotherapeutics and good immunoregulatory effects with low toxicity.  However, their underlying mechanism remains largely unclear.  We found for the first time the persistent uptake and subcellular distribution of metallofullerenols in macrophages by taking advantages of synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) with high spatial resoln. of 30 nm.  Gd@C82(OH)22 can significantly activate primary mouse macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β.  Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown shows that NLRP3 inflammasomes, but not NLRC4, participate in fullerenol-induced IL-1β prodn.  Potassium efflux, activation of P2X7 receptor and intracellular reactive oxygen speciesare also important factors required for fullerenols-induced IL-1β release.  Stronger NF-κB signal triggered by Gd@C82(OH)22 is in agreement with higher pro-IL-1β expression than C60(OH)22.  Interestingly, TLR4/MyD88 pathway but not TLR2 mediates IL-1β secretion in Gd@C82(OH)22 exposure confirmed by macrophages from MyD88-/-/TLR4-/-/TLR2-/- knockout mice, which is different from C60(OH)22.  Our work demonstrated that fullerenols can greatly activate macrophage and promote IL-1β prodn. via both TLRs/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, while Gd@C82(OH)22 had stronger ability C60(OH)22 due to the different electron affinity on the surface of carbon cage induced by the encaged gadolinium ion.\n",

In a combination of pseudopolar fast Fourier transform and the oversampling method with an iterative algorithm, equally sloped tomog. makes superior 3D reconstruction to conventional tomog. that has an intrinsic drawback due to the use of equally angled 2D projections.

      "Electron tomog. is currently the highest resoln. imaging modality available to study the 3D structures of pleomorphic macromol. assemblies, viruses, organelles and cells.  Unfortunately, the resoln. is currently limited to 3-5 nm by several factors including the dose tolerance of biol. specimens and the inaccessibility of certain tilt angles.  Here we report the first exptl. demonstration of equally-sloped tomog. (EST) to alleviate these problems.  As a proof of principle, we applied EST to reconstructing frozen-hydrated keyhole limpet hemocyanin mols. from a tilt-series taken with const. slope increments.  In comparison with weighted back-projection (WBP), the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), EST reconstructions exhibited higher contrast, less peripheral noise, more easily detectable mol. boundaries and reduced missing wedge effects.  More importantly, EST reconstructions including only two-thirds the original images appeared to have the same resoln. as full WBP reconstructions, suggesting that EST can either reduce the dose required to reach a given resoln. or allow higher resolns. to be achieved with a given dose.  EST was also applied to reconstructing a frozen-hydrated bacterial cell from a tilt-series taken with const. angular increments.  The results confirmed similar benefits when std. tilts are utilized.\n",

      "Knowledge of the interactions between nanomaterials and large-size mammalian cells, including cellular uptake, intracellular localization and translocation, has greatly advanced nanomedicine and nanotoxicol.  Imaging techniques that can locate nanomaterials within the structures of intact large-size cells at nanoscale resoln. play crucial roles in acquiring this knowledge.  Here, the quant. imaging of intracellular nanomaterials in three dimensions was performed by combining dual-energy contrast X-ray microscopy and an iterative tomog. algorithm termed equally sloped tomog. (EST).  Macrophages with a size of ∼20μm that had been exposed to the potential antitumor agent [Gd@C82(OH)22]n were investigated.  Large nos. of nanoparticles (NPs) aggregated within the cell and were mainly located in phagosomes.  No NPs were obsd. in the nucleus.  Imaging of the nanomedicine within whole cells advanced the understanding of the high-efficiency antitumor activity and the low toxicity of this agent.  This imaging technique can be used to probe nanomaterials within intact large-size cells at nanometer resoln. uniformly in three dimensions and may greatly benefit the fields of nanomedicine and nanotoxicol.\n",

      "A review.  We can learn much about cell function by imaging and quantifying sub-cellular structures, esp. if this is done non-destructively without altering said structures.  Soft X-ray tomog. (SXT) is a high-resoln. imaging technique for visualizing cells and their interior structure in 3D.  A tomogram of the cell, reconstructed from a series of 2D projection images, can be easily segmented and analyzed.  SXT has a very high specimen throughput compared to other high-resoln. structure imaging modalities; for example, tomog. data for reconstructing an entire eukaryotic cell is acquired in a matter of minutes.  SXT visualizes cells without the need for chem. fixation, dehydration, or staining of the specimen.  As a result, the SXT reconstructions are close representations of cells in their native state.  SXT is applicable to most cell types.  The deep penetration of soft X-rays allows cells, even mammalian cells, to be imaged without being sectioned.  Image contrast in SXT is generated by the differential attenuation soft X-ray illumination as it passes through the specimen.  Accordingly, each voxel in the tomog. reconstruction has a measured linear absorption coeff. (LAC) value.  LAC values are quant. and give rise to each sub-cellular component having a characteristic LAC profile, allowing organelles to be identified and segmented from the milieu of other cell contents.  In this chapter, we describe the fundamentals of SXT imaging and how this technique can answer real world questions in the study of the nucleus.  We also describe the development of correlative methods for the localization of specific mols. in a SXT reconstruction.  The combination of fluorescence and SXT data acquired from the same specimen produces composite 3D images, rich with detailed information on the inner workings of cells.\n",

      "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is spreading worldwide and keeps evolving to adapt to antibiotics, causing increasing threats in clinics, which necessitates the exploration of antimicrobial agents for not only killing of resistant cells but also prevention of AMR progression.  However, so far, there has been no effective approach.  We designed lanthanum hydroxide and graphene oxide nanocomposites (La@GO) to confer a synergistic bactericidal effect in all tested resistant strains.  More importantly, long-term exposure of Escherichia coli (AMR) to subminimum inhibitory concns. of La@GO does not trigger detectable secondary resistance, while conventional antibiotics and silver nanoparticles lead to a 16- to 64-fold increase in tolerance.  The inability of E. coli to evolve resistance to La@GO is likely due to a distinctive extracellular multitarget invasion killing mechanism involving lipid dephosphorylation, lipid peroxidn., and peptidoglycan disruption.  Overall, our results highlight La@GO nanocomposites as a promising soln. to combating resistant bacteria without inducing the evolution of AMR.\n",

      "Microscopy has greatly advanced our understanding of biol.  Although significant progress has recently been made in optical microscopy to break the diffraction-limit barrier, reliance of such techniques on fluorescent labeling technologies prohibits quant. 3D imaging of the entire contents of cells.  Cryoelectron microscopy can image pleomorphic structures at a resoln. of 3-5 nm, but is only applicable to thin or sectioned specimens.  Here, the authors report quant. 3D imaging of a whole, unstained cell at a resoln. of 50-60 nm by x-ray diffraction microscopy.  The authors identified the 3D morphol. and structure of cellular organelles including cell wall, vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, granules, nucleus, and nucleolus inside a yeast spore cell.  Furthermore, the authors obsd. a 3D structure protruding from the reconstructed yeast spore, suggesting the spore germination process.  Using cryogenic technologies, a 3D resoln. of 5-10 nm should be achievable by X-ray diffraction microscopy.  This work hence paves a way for quant. 3D imaging of a wide range of biol. specimens at nanometer-scale resolns. that are too thick for electron microscopy.\n",

      "X-ray fluorescence tomog. promises to map elemental distributions in unstained and unfixed biol. specimens in three dimensions at high resoln. and sensitivity, offering unparalleled insight in medical, biol., and environmental sciences.  X-ray fluorescence tomog. of biol. specimens has been viewed as impractical-and perhaps even impossible for routine application-due to the large time required for scanning tomog. and significant radiation dose delivered to the specimen during the imaging process.  Here, we demonstrate submicron resoln. X-ray fluorescence tomog. of a whole unstained biol. specimen, quantifying three-dimensional distributions of the elements Si, P, S, CI, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn in the freshwater diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana with 400-nm resoln., improving the spatial resoln. by over an order of magnitude.  The resulting maps faithfully reproduce cellular structure revealing unexpected patterns that may elucidate the role of metals in diatom biol. and of diatoms in global element cycles.  With anticipated improvements in data acquisition and detector sensitivity, such measurements could become routine in the near future.\n",

      "Synchrotron radiation phase-contrast computed nanotomog. (nano-CT) and two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) nanoscopic X-ray fluorescence (nano-XRF) were used to investigate the internal distribution of engineered cobalt nanoparticles (Co NPs) in exposed individuals of the nematode Caenorhabiditis elegans.  Whole nematodes and selected tissues and organs were 3D-rendered: anatomical 3D renderings with 50 nm voxel size enabled the visualization of spherical nanoparticle aggregates with size up to 200 nm within intact C. elegans.  A 20 × 37 nm2 high-brilliance beam was employed to obtain XRF elemental distribution maps of entire nematodes or anatomical details such as embryos, which could be compared with the CT data.  These maps showed Co NPs to be predominantly present within the intestine and the epithelium, and they were not colocalized with Zn granules found in the lysosome-contg. vesicles or Fe agglomerates in the intestine.  Iterated XRF scanning of a specimen at 0° and 90° angles suggested that NP aggregates were translocated into tissues outside of the intestinal lumen.  Virtual slicing by means of 2D XRF tomog., combined with holotomog., indicated presumable presence of individual NP aggregates inside the uterus and within embryos.\n",

      "Trace metals play important roles in normal and in disease-causing biol. functions.  X-ray fluorescence microscopy reveals trace elements with no dependence on binding affinities (unlike with visible light fluorophores) and with improved sensitivity relative to electron probes.  However, X-ray fluorescence is not very sensitive for showing the light elements that comprise the majority of cellular material.  Here we show that X-ray ptychog. can be combined with fluorescence to image both cellular structure and trace element distribution in frozen-hydrated cells at cryogenic temps., with high structural and chem. fidelity.  Ptychog. reconstruction algorithms deliver phase and absorption contrast images at a resoln. beyond that of the illuminating lens or beam size.  Using 5.2-keV X-rays, we have obtained sub-30-nm resoln. structural images and ∼90-nm-resoln. fluorescence images of several elements in frozen-hydrated green algae.  This combined approach offers a way to study the role of trace elements in their structural context.\n",

      "Recent developments in biol. X-ray microscopy have allowed structural information and elemental distribution to be simultaneously obtained by combining X-ray ptychog. and X-ray fluorescence microscopy.  Exptl., these methods can be performed simultaneously; however, the optimal conditions for each measurement may not be compatible.  Here, we combine two distinct measurements of ultrastructure and elemental distribution, with each measurement performed under optimized conditions.  By combining optimized ptychog. and fluorescence information we are able to det. molar concns. from two-dimensional images, allowing an investigation into the interactions between the environment sensing filopodia in fibroblasts and extracellular calcium.

      "As a representative transition metal, Fe plays a key role in chem. activities of atm. particulate matter (PM); it is involved in particle-related free radical generation and adverse health effects.  However, limited understanding of the structure and properties of individual micrometer-sized particulates obscures assessing the Fe contribution for chem. activity.  This work describes multi-dimensional anal. strategies to characterize mass, spatial distribution, and chem. forms of Fe in single haze particles using synchrotron radiation techniques.  X-ray fluorescence imaging quantified the masses of multiple metals and yielded transition metals distribution maps which revealed the types of elements which tend to occur together.  Nano-computed tomog. assessed the Fe spatial distribution, observing Fe exists as small aggregates and is concd. primarily in subsurface regions.  X-ray absorption near structures were combined with scanning transmission x-ray microscopy to quantify ferrous and ferric forms and mapped their distributions in individual particles, to probably attribute Fe chem. activity.  This work demonstrated the power of synchrotron radiation-based techniques to examine inaccessible chem. information in single haze particles, which may provide important clues about Fe chem. as a source of Fenton reactions and health effects.  Multi-faceted anal. approaches exhibited high sensitivity (sub-femtogram/particle or ∼0.2 fg/μm2) for multiple elements and are promising to study other concepts, e.g., aerosol Fe soly., heterogeneous org. matter and SO2 oxidn., and haze particle formation and aging.\n",

      "A review.  X-ray tomog. has been shown to provide insights into the internal structure of whole cells that cannot be obtained by any other means.  With recent advances in instrumentation and the advent of automated cryogenic sample stages, it has become possible to collect isotropic tomog. data from radiation-sensitive cells and to compute reconstructions with a high degree of fidelity to a resoln. of 50 nm.  The new generation of x-ray optics will extend this resoln. limit to 15 nm or better.  The development of x-ray tomog. of whole cells generates opportunities to study cells, and cellular processes, in a completely new way.\n",

      "This study addresses the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of 15-nm gold nanoparticles (NPs), either plain (i.e., stabilized with citrate) or coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), exposed to human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) at the air-liq. interface for 1, 4, and 24 h.  Quant. anal. by stereol. on transmission electron microscopy images reveals a significant, nonrandom intracellular distribution for both NP types.  No particles are obsd. in the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, or golgi.  The cytosol is not a preferred cellular compartment for both NP types, although significantly more PEG-coated than citrate-stabilized NPs are present there.  The preferred particle localizations are vesicles of different sizes (<150, 150-1000, >1000 nm).  This is obsd. for both NP types and indicates a predominant uptake by endocytosis.  Subsequent inhibition of caveolin- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis by methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) results in a significant redn. of intracellular NPs.  The inhibition, however, is more pronounced for PEG-coated than citrate-stabilized NPs.  The latter are mostly found in larger vesicles; therefore, they are potentially taken up by macropinocytosis, which is not inhibited by MβCD.  With prolonged exposure times, both NPs are preferentially localized in larger-sized intracellular vesicles such as lysosomes, thus indicating intracellular particle trafficking.  This quant. evaluation reveals that NP surface coatings modulate endocytotic uptake pathways and cellular NP trafficking.  Other nonendocytotic entry mechanisms are found to be involved as well, as indicated by localization of a minority of PEG-coated NPs in the cytosol.\n",

      "To visualize the distributions of trace elements in biol. samples such as tissues and cells at high spatial resoln., the authors developed a scanning x-ray fluorescence microscope (SXFM) at SPring-8, using a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror optics that enables achromatic and highly efficient focusing.  To evaluate performance regarding its application to biol. samples, the SXFM was used at x-ray energy of 15 keV to observe NIH/3T3 cells in which ATP synthase β (specifically localized at the mitochondria) were labeled with gold colloidal particles.  Various elemental distributions were visualized at the single-cell level, including those for P, S, Cl, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Au, and high-resoln. elemental distribution maps were obtained by magnifying the labeled single mitochondrion.  Maximum spatial resoln. achieved in the expts. was sub-100 nm.\n",

      "Spatial resoln. defines the phys. limit of microscopes for probing biomol. localization and interactions in cells.  Whereas synchrotron-based X-ray microscopy (XRM) represents a unique approach for imaging a whole cell with nanoscale resoln. due to its intrinsic nanoscale resoln. and great penetration ability, existing approaches to label biomols. rely on the use of exogenous tags that are multi-step and error-prone.  Here, we repurpose engineered peroxidases as genetically encoded X-ray-sensitive tags (GXET) for site-specific labeling of protein-of-interest in mammalian cells.  We fiend that 3,3''-diaminobenzidine (DAB) polymers that are in-situ catalytically formed by fusion-expressed peroxidases are visible under XRM.  Using this new tag, we imaged the protein location assocd. with the alteration of a DNA-methylation pathway with an ultra-high resoln. of 30 nm.  Importantly, the excellent energy resoln. of XRM enables multicolor imaging using different peroxidase tags.  The development of GXET enlightens the way to nanoscopic imaging for biol. studies.\n",

      "We report for the first time seeing and counting integrin αIIbβ3 on a single-cell level.  The proposed method is based on the using of the Au cluster probe.  With the fluorescent property of Au24 cluster and the specific targeting ability of peptide, our probe can directly visualize integrin αIIbβ3 on the membrane of human erythroleukemia cells (HEL) via confocal microscopy.  On the basis of the accurate formula of our probe (Au24Peptide8), the no. of integrin αIIbβ3 can be precisely counted by quantifying the gold content on a single HEL cell via laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  Our results reveal that the no. of integrin αIIbβ3 on a single cell varies from 5.75 × 10-17 to 9.11 × 10-17 mol, because of the heteroexpression levels of αIIbβ3 on individual cells.\n",

      "BACKGROUND:  Comparative, functional, and developmental studies of animal morphology require accurate visualization of three-dimensional structures, but few widely applicable methods exist for non-destructive whole-volume imaging of animal tissues.  Quantitative studies in particular require accurately aligned and calibrated volume images of animal structures.  X-ray microtomography (microCT) has the potential to produce quantitative 3D images of small biological samples, but its widespread use for non-mineralized tissues has been limited by the low x-ray contrast of soft tissues.  Although osmium staining and a few other techniques have been used for contrast enhancement, generally useful methods for microCT imaging for comparative morphology are still lacking.  RESULTS:  Several very simple and versatile staining methods are presented for microCT imaging of animal soft tissues, along with advice on tissue fixation and sample preparation.  The stains, based on inorganic iodine and phosphotungstic acid, are easier to handle and much less toxic than osmium, and they produce high-contrast x-ray images of a wide variety of soft tissues.  The breadth of possible applications is illustrated with a few microCT images of model and non-model animals, including volume and section images of vertebrates, embryos, insects, and other invertebrates.  Each image dataset contains x-ray absorbance values for every point in the imaged volume, and objects as small as individual muscle fibers and single blood cells can be resolved in their original locations and orientations within the sample.  CONCLUSION:  With very simple contrast staining, microCT imaging can produce quantitative, high-resolution, high-contrast volume images of animal soft tissues, without destroying the specimens and with possibilities of combining with other preparation and imaging methods.  Such images are expected to be useful in comparative, developmental, functional, and quantitative studies of morphology.\n",

      "Phase objects are readily imaged through Fresnel diffraction in the hard x-ray beams of 3rd-generation synchrotron radiation sources such as the ESRF, due essentially to the very small angular size of the source.  Phase objects can lead to spurious contrast in x-ray diffraction images (topographs) of crystals.  This contrast can be eliminated through random phase plates, which provide an effective way of tailoring the angular size of the source.  The possibilities of this very simple technique for imaging phase objects in the hard x-ray range are explored exptl. and discussed.  They appear very promising, as shown in particular by the example of a piece of human vertebra, and could be extended to phase tomog.\n",

      "Manganese (Mn) is an essential metal that can be neurotoxic when elevated exposition occurs leading to parkinsonian-like syndromes.  Mutations in the Slc30a10 gene have been identified in new forms of familial parkinsonism.  SLC30A10 is a cell surface protein involved in the efflux of Mn protecting the cell against Mn toxicity.  Disease causing mutations block the efflux activity of SLC30A10, resulting in Mn accumulation.  Detg. the intracellular localization of Mn when disease-causing SLC30A10 mutants are expressed is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity.  Here, using organelle fluorescence microscopy and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) imaging we found that Mn accumulates in the Golgi app. of human cells transfected with the disease-causing SLC30A10-Δ105-107 mutant under physiol. conditions and after exposure to Mn.  In cells expressing the wild-type SLC30A10 protein, cellular Mn content was low after all exposure conditions, confirming efficient Mn efflux.  In non-transfected cells that do not express endogenous SLC30A10, and in mock transfected cells, Mn was located in the Golgi app., similarly to its distribution in cells expressing the mutant protein, confirming deficient Mn efflux.  The newly developed SXRF cryogenic nanoimaging (<50 nm resoln.) indicated that Mn was trapped in single vesicles within the Golgi app.  Our results confirm the role of SLC30A10 in Mn efflux and the accumulation of Mn in cells expressing the disease causing SLC30A10-Δ105-107 mutation.  Moreover, we identified suborganelle Golgi nanovesicles as the main compartment of Mn accumulation in SLC30A10 mutants suggesting interactions with the vesicular trafficking machinery as a cause of the disease.\n",

      "Sequestration within the cytoplasm often limits the efficacy of therapeutic nanoparticles that have specific subcellular targets.  To allow for both cellular and subcellular nanoparticle delivery, we have created epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted Fe3O4@TiO2 nanoparticles that use the native intracellular trafficking of EGFR to improve internalization and nuclear translocation in EGFR-expressing HeLa cells.  While bound to EGFR, these nanoparticles do not interfere with the interaction between EGFR and karyopherin-β, a protein that is crit. for the translocation of ligand-bound EGFR to the nucleus.  Thus, a portion of the EGFR-targeted nanoparticles taken up by the cells also reaches cell nuclei.  We were able to track nanoparticle accumulation in cells by flow cytometry and nanoparticle subcellular distribution by confocal fluorescent microscopy indirectly, using fluorescently labeled nanoparticles.  More importantly, we imaged and quantified intracellular nanoparticles directly, by their elemental signatures, using X-ray fluorescence microscopy at the Bionanoprobe, the first instrument of its kind in the world.  The Bionanoprobe can focus hard X-rays down to a 30 nm spot size to map the positions of chem. elements tomog. within whole frozen-hydrated cells.  Finally, we show that photoactivation of targeted nanoparticles in cell nuclei, dependent on successful EGFR nuclear accumulation, induces significantly more double-stranded DNA breaks than photoactivation of nanoparticles that remain exclusively in the cytoplasm.\n",

      "X-ray tomography at the level of single biological cells is possible in a low-dose regime, based on full-field holographic recordings, with phase contrast originating from free-space wave propagation.  Building upon recent progress in cellular imaging based on the illumination by quasi-point sources provided by X-ray waveguides, here this approach is extended in several ways.  First, the phase-retrieval algorithms are extended by an optimized deterministic inversion, based on a multi-distance recording.  Second, different advanced forms of iterative phase retrieval are used, operational for single-distance and multi-distance recordings.  Results are compared for several different preparations of macrophage cells, for different staining and labelling.  As a result, it is shown that phase retrieval is no longer a bottleneck for holographic imaging of cells, and how advanced schemes can be implemented to cope also with high noise and inconsistencies in the data.\n",

      "However, the effects of different methods of exposure on their translocation, biosafety, and biotransformation-related degradability remain unclear.  In this study, we combined the advantages of synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and high-resoln. single-cell SR transmission X-ray microscopy (SR-TXM) with traditional anal. techniques to investigate translocation, precise degraded species/ratio, and correlation between the degrdn. and toxicity levels of polyvinylpyrrolidone-modified 2H-phase MoS2 nanosheets (MoS2-PVP NSs).  These NSs demonstrated different biodegradability levels in biomicroenvironments with H2O2, catalase, and human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) (H2O2 < catalase < hMPO).  The effects of NSs and their biodegraded byproducts on cell viability and 3D translocation at the single-cell level were also assessed.  After i.g. administration, NSs accumulated in the gastrointestinal organs and were excreted from feces within 48 h.  After i.v. injection, NSs showed noticeable clearance due to their decreased accumulation in the liver and spleen within 30 days when compared with that in the i.p. group, which exhibited slight accumulation in the spleen.  This work paves the way for understanding the biol. behaviors of nano-MoS2 using SR techniques that provide more opportunities for future applications.\n",

      "We have performed x-ray phase-contrast tomog. on mouse lung tissue.  Using a divergent x-ray beam generated by nanoscale focusing, we used zoom tomog. to produce three-dimensional reconstructions with selectable magnification, resoln., and field of view.  Thus, macroscopic tissue samples extending over several mm can be studied in sub-cellular-level structural detail.  The zoom capability and, in particular, the high dose efficiency are enabled by the near-perfect exit wavefront of an optimized x-ray waveguide channel.  In combination with suitable phase-retrieval algorithms, challenging radiation-sensitive and low-contrast samples can be reconstructed with minimal artifacts.  The dose efficiency of the method is demonstrated by the reconstruction of living macrophages both with and without phagocytized contrast agents.  We also used zoom tomog. to visualize barium-labeled macrophages in the context of morphol. structures in asthmatic and healthy mouse lung tissue one day after intratracheal application.  The three-dimensional reconstructions showed that the macrophages predominantly localized to the alveoli, but they were also found in bronchial walls, indicating that these cells might be able to migrate from the lumen of the bronchi through the epithelium.\n",

      "The degenerative effects of multiple sclerosis at the level of the vascular and neuronal networks in the central nervous system are currently the object of intensive investigation.  Preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for multiple sclerosis, but the neuropathology of specific lesions in EAE and the effects of MSC treatment are under debate.  Because conventional imaging techniques entail protocols that alter the tissues, limiting the reliability of the results, we have used non-invasive X-ray phase-contrast tomography to obtain an unprecedented direct 3D characterization of EAE lesions at micro-to-nano scales, with simultaneous imaging of the vascular and neuronal networks.  We reveal EAE-mediated alterations down to the capillary network.  Our findings shed light on how the disease and MSC treatment affect the tissues, and promote X-ray phase-contrast tomography as a powerful tool for studying neurovascular diseases and monitoring advanced therapies.\n",

      "Studies of brain cytoarchitecture in mammals are routinely performed by serial sectioning of the specimen and staining of the sections.  The procedure is labor-intensive and the 3D architecture can only be determined after aligning individual 2D sections, leading to a reconstructed volume with non-isotropic resolution.  Propagation-based x-ray phase-contrast tomography offers a unique potential for high-resolution 3D imaging of intact biological specimen due to the high penetration depth and potential resolution.  We here show that even compact laboratory CT at an optimized liquid-metal jet microfocus source combined with suitable phase-retrieval algorithms and a novel tissue preparation can provide cellular and subcellular resolution in millimeter sized samples of mouse brain.  We removed water and lipids from entire mouse brains and measured the remaining dry tissue matrix in air, lowering absorption but increasing phase contrast.  We present single-cell resolution images of mouse brain cytoarchitecture and show that axons can be revealed in myelinated fiber bundles.  In contrast to optical 3D techniques our approach does neither require staining of cells nor tissue clearing, procedures that are increasingly difficult to apply with increasing sample and brain sizes.  The approach thus opens a novel route for high-resolution high-throughput studies of brain architecture in mammals.\n",

      "To quantitatively evaluate brain tissue and its corresponding function, knowledge of the 3D cellular distribution is essential.  The gold standard to obtain this information is histology, a destructive and labor-intensive technique where the specimen is sliced and examined under a light microscope, providing 3D information at nonisotropic resolution.  To overcome the limitations of conventional histology, we use phase-contrast X-ray tomography with optimized optics, reconstruction, and image analysis, both at a dedicated synchrotron radiation endstation, which we have equipped with X-ray waveguide optics for coherence and wavefront filtering, and at a compact laboratory source.  As a proof-of-concept demonstration we probe the 3D cytoarchitecture in millimeter-sized punches of unstained human cerebellum embedded in paraffin and show that isotropic subcellular resolution can be reached at both setups throughout the specimen.  To enable a quantitative analysis of the reconstructed data, we demonstrate automatic cell segmentation and localization of over 1 million neurons within the cerebellar cortex.  This allows for the analysis of the spatial organization and correlation of cells in all dimensions by borrowing concepts from condensed-matter physics, indicating a strong short-range order and local clustering of the cells in the granular layer.  By quantification of 3D neuronal \"packing,\" we can hence shed light on how the human cerebellum accommodates 80% of the total neurons in the brain in only 10% of its volume.  In addition, we show that the distribution of neighboring neurons in the granular layer is anisotropic with respect to the Purkinje cell dendrites.\n",

      "Purpose: We present a phase-contrast x-ray tomography study of wild type C57BL/6 mouse hearts as a nondestructive approach to the microanatomy on the scale of the entire excised organ.  Based on the partial coherence at a home-built phase-contrast [Formula: see text] setup installed at a liquid metal jet source, we exploit phase retrieval and hence achieve superior image quality for heart tissue, almost comparable to previous synchrotron data on the whole organ scale.  Approach: In our work, different embedding methods and heavy metal-based stains have been explored.  From the tomographic reconstructions, quantitative structural parameters describing the three-dimensional (3-D) architecture have been derived by two different fiber tracking algorithms.  The first algorithm is based on the local gradient of the reconstructed electron density.  By performing a principal component analysis on the local structure-tensor of small subvolumes, the dominant direction inside the volume can be determined.  In addition to this approach, which is already well established for heart tissue, we have implemented and tested an algorithm that is based on a local 3-D Fourier transform.  Results: We showed that the choice of sample preparation influences the 3-D structure of the tissue, not only in terms of contrast but also with respect to the structural preservation.  A heart prepared with the evaporation-of-solvent method was used to compare both algorithms.  The results of structural orientation were very similar for both approaches.  In addition to the determination of the fiber orientation, the degree of filament alignment and local thickness of single muscle fiber bundles were obtained using the Fourier-based approach.  Conclusions: Phase-contrast x-ray tomography allows for investigating the structure of heart tissue with an isotropic resolution below [Formula: see text] .  The fact that this is possible with compact laboratory instrumentation opens up new opportunities for screening samples and optimizing sample preparation, also prior to synchrotron beamtimes.  Further, results from the structural analysis can help in understanding cardiovascular diseases or can be used to improve computational models of the heart.\n",

      "Cerebral ischemia is associated with a lack of oxygen and high-energy phosphates within the brain tissue, leading to irreversible cell injury.  Visualizing these cellular injuries has long been a focus of experimental stroke research with application of immunohistochemistry as one of the standard approaches.  It is, however, a destructive imaging technique with non-isotropic resolution, as only the two-dimensional tissue structure of a thin brain section is visualized using optical microscopy and specific stainings.  Herein, we extend the structural analysis of mouse brain tissue after cerebral ischemia to the third dimension via microfocus computed tomography (μ-CT).  Contrast of the weakly absorbing unstained brain tissue is enhanced by phase contrast.  We show that recordings at two different magnifications and fields of view can be combined as a single approach for visualization of the associated structural alterations at isotropic resolution, from the level of the whole organ down to single cells.\n",

      "This article presents scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) expts. on the actomyosin assemblies in freeze-dried neo-natal rat cardiac muscle cells.  By scanning the cells through a sub-micrometre focused beam, the local structure and filament orientation can be probed and quantified.  To this end, SAXS data were recorded and analyzed directly in reciprocal space to generate maps of different structural parameters (scanning SAXS).  The scanning SAXS expts. were complemented by full-field holog. imaging of the projected electron d., following a slight rearrangement of the instrumental setup.  It is shown that X-ray holog. is ideally suited to complete missing scattering data at low momentum transfer in the structure factor, extending the covered range of spatial frequencies by two orders of magnitude.  Regions of interest for scanning can be easily selected on the basis of the electron d. maps.  Finally, the combination of scanning SAXS and holog. allows for a direct verification of possible radiation-induced structural changes in the cell.\n",

      "We have used X-ray phase contrast tomography to resolve the structure of uncut, entire myelinated optic, saphenous and sciatic mouse nerves.  Intrinsic electron density contrast suffices to identify axonal structures.  Specific myelin labeling by an osmium tetroxide stain enables distinction between axon and surrounding myelin sheath.  Utilization of spherical wave illumination enables zooming capabilities which enable imaging of entire sciatic internodes as well as identification of sub-structures such as nodes of Ranvier and Schmidt-Lanterman incisures.\n",

      "We analyze the signal and noise propagation of differential phase-contrast computed tomography (PCT) compared with conventional attenuation-based computed tomography (CT) from a theoretical point of view.  This work focuses on grating-based differential phase-contrast imaging.  A mathematical framework is derived that is able to analytically predict the relative performance of both imaging techniques in the sense of the relative contrast-to-noise ratio for the contrast of any two materials.  Two fundamentally different properties of PCT compared with CT are identified.  First, the noise power spectra show qualitatively different characteristics implying a resolution-dependent performance ratio.  The break-even point is derived analytically as a function of system parameters such as geometry and visibility.  A superior performance of PCT compared with CT can only be achieved at a sufficiently high spatial resolution.  Second, due to periodicity of phase information which is non-ambiguous only in a bounded interval statistical phase wrapping can occur.  This effect causes a collapse of information propagation for low signals which limits the applicability of phase-contrast imaging at low dose.\n",

      "We report the synthesis, characterization, and utilization of gadolinum-loaded dendrimer-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Gd-Au DENPs) for dual mode computed tomog. (CT)/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging applications.  In this study, amine-terminated generation five poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (G5.NH2) modified with gadolinium (Gd) chelator and polyethylene glycol (PEG) monomethyl ether were used as templates to synthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).  Followed by sequential chelation of Gd(III) and acetylation of the remaining dendrimer terminal amine groups, multifunctional Gd-Au DENPs were formed.  The formed Gd-Au DENPs were characterized via different techniques.  We show that the formed Gd-Au DENPs are colloidally stable and non-cytotoxic at an Au concn. up to 50 μm.  With the coexistence of two radiodense imaging elements of AuNPs and Gd(III) within one NP system, the formed Gd-Au DENPs display both r1 relaxivity for MR imaging mode and X-ray attenuation property for CT imaging mode, which enables CT/MR dual mode imaging of the heart, liver, kidney, and bladder of rat or mouse within a time frame of 45 min.  Furthermore, in vivo biodistribution studies reveal that the Gd-Au DENPs have an extended blood circulation time and can be cleared from the major organs within 24 h.  The strategy to use facile dendrimer technol. to design dual mode contrast agents may be extended to prep. multifunctional platforms for targeted multimode mol. imaging of various biol. systems.\n",

      "As an intensely studied computed tomog. (CT) contrast agent, gold nanoparticle has been suggested to be combined with fluorescence imaging modality to offset the low sensitivity of CT.  However, the strong quenching of gold nanoparticle on fluorescent dyes requires complicated design and shielding to overcome.  Herein, we report a unique nanoprobe (M-NPAPF-Au) co-loading an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) red dye and gold nanoparticles into DSPE-PEG2000 micelles for dual-modal fluorescence/CT imaging.  The nanoprobe was prepd. based on a facile method of \"one-pot ultrasonic emulsification\".  Surprisingly, in the micelles system, fluorescence dye (NPAPF) efficiently overcame the strong fluorescence quenching of shielding-free gold nanoparticles and retained the crucial AIE feature.  In vivo studies demonstrated the nanoprobe had superior tumor-targeting ability, excellent fluorescence and CT imaging effects.  The totality of present studies clearly indicates the significant potential application of M-NPAPF-Au as a dual-modal non-invasive fluorescence/X-ray CT nanoprobe for in vivo tumor-targeted imaging and diagnosis.\n",

      "Photon-counting CT is an emerging technology with the potential to dramatically change clinical CT.  Photon-counting CT uses new energy-resolving x-ray detectors, with mechanisms that differ substantially from those of conventional energy-integrating detectors.  Photon-counting CT detectors count the number of incoming photons and measure photon energy.  This technique results in higher contrast-to-noise ratio, improved spatial resolution, and optimized spectral imaging.  Photon-counting CT can reduce radiation exposure, reconstruct images at a higher resolution, correct beam-hardening artifacts, optimize the use of contrast agents, and create opportunities for quantitative imaging relative to current CT technology.  In this review, the authors will explain the technical principles of photon-counting CT in nonmathematical terms for radiologists and clinicians.  Following a general overview of the current status of photon-counting CT, they will explain potential clinical applications of this technology.\n",

      "A review.  Spectral photon-counting CT (SPCCT) is an emerging X-ray imaging technol. that extends the scope of available diagnostic imaging tools.  The main advantage of photon-counting CT technol. is better sampling of the spectral information from the transmitted spectrum in order to benefit from addnl. phys. information being produced during matter interaction, including photo-elec. and Compton effects, and the K-edge effect.  The K-edge, which is specific for a given element, is the increase in X-ray absorption of the element above the binding energy between its inner electronic shell and the nucleus.  Hence, the spectral information contributes to better characterization of tissues and materials of interest, explaining the excitement surrounding this area of X-ray imaging.  Other improvements of SPCCT compared with conventional CT, such as higher spatial resoln., lower radiation exposure and lower noise are also expected to provide benefits for diagnostic imaging.  In this review, we describe multi-energy CT imaging, from dual energy to photon counting technol., and our initial experience results using a clin.-scale spectral photon counting CT (SPCCT) prototype system in vitro and in vivo.  In addn., possible clin. applications are introduced.\n",

      "PURPOSE:  To demonstrate the feasibility of spectral imaging using photon-counting detector (PCD) x-ray computed tomography (CT) for simultaneous material decomposition of three contrast agents in vivo in a large animal model.  METHODS:  This Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved study used a canine model.  Bismuth subsalicylate was administered orally 24-72 h before imaging.  PCD CT was performed during intravenous administration of 40-60 ml gadoterate meglumine; 3.5 min later, iopamidol 370 was injected intravenously.  Renal PCD CT images were acquired every 2 s for 5-6 min to capture the wash-in and wash-out kinetics of the contrast agents.  Least mean squares linear material decomposition was used to calculate the concentrations of contrast agents in the aorta, renal cortex, renal medulla and renal pelvis.  RESULTS:  Using reference vials with known concentrations of materials, we computed molar concentrations of the various contrast agents during each phase of CT scanning.  Material concentration maps allowed simultaneous quantification of both arterial and delayed renal enhancement in a single CT acquisition.  The accuracy of the material decomposition algorithm in a test phantom was -0.4 ± 2.2 mM, 0.3 ± 2.2 mM for iodine and gadolinium solutions, respectively.  Peak contrast concentration of gadolinium and iodine in the aorta, renal cortex, and renal medulla were observed 16, 24, and 60 s after the start each injection, respectively.  CONCLUSION:  Photon-counting spectral CT allowed simultaneous material decomposition of multiple contrast agents in vivo.  Besides defining contrast agent concentrations, tissue enhancement at multiple phases was observed in a single CT acquisition, potentially obviating the need for multiphase CT scans and thus reducing radiation dose.\n",

      "A new prototype spectral photon-counting computed tomography (SPCCT) based on a modified clinical CT system has been developed.  SPCCT analysis of the energy composition of the transmitted x-ray spectrum potentially allows simultaneous dual contrast agent imaging, however, this has not yet been demonstrated with such a system.  We investigated the feasibility of using this system to distinguish gold nanoparticles (AuNP) and an iodinated contrast agent.  The contrast agents and calcium phosphate were imaged in phantoms.  Conventional CT, gold K-edge, iodine and water images were produced and demonstrated accurate discrimination and quantification of gold and iodine concentrations in a phantom containing mixtures of the contrast agents.  In vivo experiments were performed using New Zealand White rabbits at several times points after injections of AuNP and iodinated contrast agents.  We found that the contrast material maps clearly differentiated the distributions of gold and iodine in the tissues allowing quantification of the contrast agents' concentrations, which matched their expected pharmacokinetics.  Furthermore, rapid, repetitive scanning was done, which allowed measurement of contrast agent kinetics with high temporal resolution.  In conclusion, a clinical scale, high count rate SPCCT system is able to discriminate gold and iodine contrast media in different organs in vivo.\n",

      "We report a novel mol. imaging agent based on ytterbium designed for use with spectral \"multicolor\" computed tomog. (CT).  Spectral CT or multicolored CT provides all of the benefits of traditional CT, such as rapid tomog. X-ray imaging, but in addn., it simultaneously discriminates metal-rich contrast agents based on the element's unique X-ray K-edge energy signature.  Our synthetic approach involved the use of organically sol. Yb(III) complex to produce nanocolloids of Yb of noncryst. nature incorporating a high d. of Yb (>500K/nanoparticle) into a stable metal particle.  The resultant particles are constrained to vasculature (∼200 nm) and are highly selective for binding fibrin in the ruptured atherosclerotic plaque.  Nanoparticles exhibited excellent signal sensitivity, and the spectral CT technique uniquely discriminates the K-edge signal (60 keV) of Yb from calcium (bones).  Bioelimination and preliminary biodistribution reflected the overall safety and defined clearance of these particles in a rodent model.\n",

The detection and quantification of ruptured plaque in coronary arteries, one of the major aims in cardiol., can now be envisioned given the rapid acquisition and high X-ray energy resoln. expected from spectral CT.

      "Computed tomog. (CT) is an X-ray-based medical imaging technique commonly used for noninvasive gastrointestinal tract (GIT) imaging.  Iodine- and barium-based CT contrast agents are used in the clinic for GIT imaging; however, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) imaging is challenging since iodinated and barium-based CT agents are not specific for sites of inflammation.  Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeNP) can produce strong X-ray attenuation due to cerium's k-edge at 40.4 keV but have not yet been explored for CT imaging.  In addn., we hypothesized that the use of dextran as a coating material on cerium oxide nanoparticles would encourage accumulation in IBD inflammation sites in a similar fashion to other inflammatory diseases.  In this study, therefore, we sought to develop a CT contrast agent, i.e., dextran-coated cerium oxide nanoparticles (Dex-CeNP) for GIT imaging with IBD.  We synthesized Dex-CeNP, characterized them using various anal. tools, and examd. their in vitro biocompatibility, CT contrast generation, and protective effect against oxidative stress.  In vivo CT imaging was done with both healthy mice and a dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis mouse model.  Dex-CeNP's CT contrast generation and accumulation in inflammation sites were compared with iopamidol, an FDA approved CT contrast agent.  Dex-CeNP was found to be protective against oxidative damage.  Dex-CeNP produced strong CT contrast and accumulated in the colitis area of large intestines.  In addn., >97% of oral doses were cleared from the body within 24 h.  Therefore, Dex-CeNP can be used as a potential CT contrast agent for imaging GIT with IBD while protecting against oxidative damage.\n",

      "Spectral photon counting computed tomog. (SPCCT) is an emerging medical imaging technol.  SPCCT scanners record the energy of incident photons, which allows specific detection of contrast agents due to measurement of their characteristic X-ray attenuation profiles.  This approach is known as K-edge imaging.  Nanoparticles formed from elements such as gold, bismuth or ytterbium have been reported as potential contrast agents for SPCCT imaging.  Furthermore, gold nanoparticles have many applications in medicine, such as adjuvants for radiotherapy and photothermal ablation.  In particular, longitudinal imaging of the biodistribution of nanoparticles would be highly attractive for their clin. translation.  We therefore studied the capabilities of a novel SPCCT scanner to quantify the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles in vivo.  PEGylated gold nanoparticles were used.  Phantom imaging showed that concns. measured on gold images correlated well with known concns. (slope = 0.94, intercept = 0.18, RMSE = 0.18, R2 = 0.99).  The SPCCT system allowed repetitive and quick acquisitions in vivo, and follow-up of changes in the AuNP biodistribution over time.  Measurements performed on gold images correlated with the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurements in the organs of interest (slope = 0.77, intercept = 0.47, RMSE = 0.72, R2 = 0.93).  TEM results were in agreement with the imaging and ICP-OES in that much higher concns. of AuNPs were obsd. in the liver, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes (mainly in macrophages).  In conclusion, we found that SPCCT can be used for repetitive and non-invasive detn. of the biodistribution of gold nanoparticles in vivo.\n",

Among them, Au NPs have been considered as the most interesting nanomaterial because of its unique optical, electronic, sensing and biochem. properties.  Au NPs have been potentially applied for medical imaging, drug delivery, and tumor therapy in the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases.  This review focuses on some recent advances in the use of Au NPs as drug carriers for the intracellular delivery of therapeutics and as mol. nanoprobes for the detection and monitoring of target mols.\n",

      "Microsynchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (μ-SR-XRF) is an X-ray procedure that utilizes synchrotron radiation as an excitation source. μ-SR-XRF is a rapid, nondestructive technique that allows mapping and quantification of metals and biol. important elements in cell or tissue samples.  Generally, the intratumor distribution of nanocarrier-based therapeutics is assessed by tracing the distribution of a labeled nanocarrier within tumor tissue, rather than by tracing the encapsulated drug.  Instead of targeting the delivery vehicle, we employed μ-SR-XRF to visualize the intratumoral microdistribution of oxaliplatin (l-OHP) encapsulated within PEGylated liposomes.  Tumor-bearing mice were i.v. injected with either l-OHP-contg. PEGylated liposomes (l-OHP liposomes) or free l-OHP.  The intratumor distribution of l-OHP within tumor sections was detd. by detecting the fluorescence of platinum atoms, which are the main elemental components of l-OHP.  The l-OHP in the liposomal formulation was localized near the tumor vessels and accumulated in tumors at concns. greater than those seen with the free form, which is consistent with the results of our previous study that focused on fluorescent labeling of PEGylated liposomes.  In addn., repeated administration of l-OHP liposomes substantially enhanced the tumor accumulation and/or intratumor distribution of a subsequent dose of l-OHP liposomes, presumably via improvements in tumor vascular permeability, which is also consistent with our previous results.  In conclusion, μ-SR-XRF imaging efficiently and directly traced the intratumor distribution of the active pharmaceutical ingredient l-OHP encapsulated in liposomes within tumor tissue. μ-SR-XRF imaging could be a powerful means for estg. tissue distribution and even predicting the pharmacol. effect of nanocarrier-based anticancer metal compds.\n",

      "We applied SR-XRF to visualize the distribution of platinum and other elements in 30 rectal cancer specimens resected from patients who received L-OHP-based preoperative chemotherapy and quantified platinum concn. in the tumor epithelium and stroma, resp., using calibration curves.  The platinum concn. in rectal cancer tissue ranged 2.85-11.44 ppm, and the detection limit of platinum was 1.848 ppm.  In the tumor epithelium, the platinum concn. was significantly higher in areas of degeneration caused by chemotherapy than in nondegenerated area (p < 0.001).  Conversely, in the tumor stroma, the platinum concn. was significantly higher in patients with limited therapeutic responses than in those with strong therapeutic responses (p < 0.001).  Furthermore, multivariate anal. illustrated that higher platinum concn. in the tumor stroma was an independent predictive factor of limited histol. response (odds ratio; 19.99, 95% confidence interval; 2.04-196.37, p = 0.013).  This is the first study to visualize and quantify the distribution of platinum in human cancer tissues using SR-XRF.  These results suggest that SR-XRF anal. may contribute to predicting the therapeutic effect of L-OHP-based chemotherapy by quantifying the distribution of platinum.\n",

      "To improve the prognosis of glioblastoma, innovative radiotherapy regimens are required to augment the effect of tolerable radiation doses while sparing surrounding tissues.  In this context, nanoscintillators are emerging radiotherapeutics that down-convert X-rays into photons with energies ranging from UV to near-IR.  During radiotherapy, these scintillating properties amplify radiation-induced damage by UV-C emission or photodynamic effects.  Addnl., nanoscintillators that contain high-Z elements are likely to induce another, currently unexplored effect: radiation dose-enhancement.  This phenomenon stems from a higher photoelec. absorption of orthovoltage X-rays by high-Z elements compared to tissues, resulting in increased prodn. of tissue-damaging photo- and Auger electrons.  In this study, Geant4 simulations reveal that rare-earth composite LaF3:Ce nanoscintillators effectively generate photo- and Auger-electrons upon orthovoltage X-rays.  3D spatially resolved X-ray fluorescence microtomog. shows that LaF3:Ce highly concs. in microtumors and enhances radiotherapy in an X-ray energy-dependent manner.  In an aggressive syngeneic model of orthotopic glioblastoma, intracerebral injection of LaF3:Ce is well tolerated and achieves complete tumor remission in 15% of the subjects receiving monochromatic synchrotron radiotherapy.  This study provides unequivocal evidence for radiation dose-enhancement by nanoscintillators, eliciting a prominent radiotherapeutic effect.  Altogether, nanoscintillators have invaluable properties for enhancing the focal damage of radiotherapy in glioblastoma and other radioresistant cancers.\n",

      "Fibrous particles interact with cells and organisms in complex ways that can lead to cellular dysfunction, cell death, inflammation, and disease.  The development of conductive transparent networks (CTNs) composed of metallic silver nanowires (AgNWs) for flexible touchscreen displays raises new possibilities for the intimate contact between novel fibers and human skin.  Here, we report that a material property, nanowire-bending stiffness that is a function of diam., controls the cytotoxicity of AgNWs to nonimmune cells from humans, mice, and fish without deterioration of crit. CTN performance parameters: elec. cond. and optical transparency.  Both 30- and 90-nm-diam. AgNWs are readily internalized by cells, but thinner NWs are mech. crumpled by the forces imposed during or after endocytosis, while thicker nanowires puncture the enclosing membrane and release silver ions and lysosomal contents to the cytoplasm, thereby initiating oxidative stress.  This finding extends the fiber pathol. paradigm and will enable the manuf. of safer products incorporating AgNWs.\n",

      "A variety of transition metal complexes exhibit anticancer activity, but their target sites in cells need to be identified and mechanisms of action elucidated.  Here, the sub-cellular distribution of [Os(η6-p-cym)(Azpy-NMe2)I]+ (p-cym=p-cymene, Azpy-NMe2=2-(p-[dimethylamino]phenylazo)pyridine) (1), a promising drug candidate, can be mapped in human ovarian cancer cells at pharmacol. concns. using a synchrotron x-ray fluorescence nanoprobe (SXRFN).  SXRFN data for Os, Zn, Ca, and P, as well as TEM and ICP anal. of mitochondrial fractions suggest localization of Os in mitochondria and not in the nucleus, accompanied by mobilization of Ca from the endoplasmic reticulum, a signaling event for cell death.  These data are consistent with the ability of (1) to induce rapid bursts of reactive oxygen species and esp. superoxide formed in the first step of O2 redn. in mitochondria.  Such metabolic targeting differs from the action of Pt drugs, offering promise for combating Pt resistance, which is a current clin. problem.\n",

      "While the role of microorganisms as main drivers of metal mobility and mineral formation under Earth surface conditions is now widely accepted, the formation of secondary gold (Au) is commonly attributed to abiotic processes.  Here, the authors report that the biomineralization of Au nanoparticles in the metallophillic bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 is the result of Au-regulated gene expression leading to the energy-dependent reductive pptn. of toxic Au(III)-complexes.  C. metallidurans, which forms biofilms on Au grains, rapidly accumulates Au(III)-complexes from soln.  Bulk and microbeam synchrotron X-ray analyses revealed that cellular Au accumulation is coupled to the formation of Au(I)-S complexes.  This process promotes Au toxicity and C. metallidurans reacts by inducing oxidative stress and metal resistances gene clusters (including a Au-specific operon) to promote cellular defense.  As a result, Au detoxification is mediated by a combination of efflux, redn., and possibly methylation of Au-complexes, leading to the formation of Au(I)-C-compds. and nanoparticulate Au0.  Similar particles were obsd. in bacterial biofilms on Au grains, suggesting that bacteria actively contribute to the formation of Au grains in surface environments.  The recognition of specific genetic responses to Au opens the way for the development of bioexploration and bioprocessing tools.\n",

      "Using synchrotron x-ray fluorescence mapping, we have examd. the uptake and localization of org. mercury in zebrafish larvae.  Strikingly, the greatest accumulation of Me and Et mercury compds. was highly localized in the rapidly dividing lens epithelium, with lower levels going to brain, optic nerve, and various other organs.  The data suggest that the reported impairment of visual processes by mercury may arise not only from previously reported neurol. effects, but also from direct effects on the ocular tissue.  This novel approach is a powerful tool for directly investigating the mol. toxicol. of heavy metals, and should be equally applicable to the study of a wide range of elements in developing embryos.\n",

      "The increasing prevalence of tattoos provoked safety concerns with respect to particle distribution and effects inside the human body.  We used skin and lymphatic tissues from human corpses to address local biokinetics by means of synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques at both the micro (μ) and nano (ν) scale.  Additional advanced mass spectrometry-based methodology enabled to demonstrate simultaneous transport of organic pigments, heavy metals and titanium dioxide from skin to regional lymph nodes.  Among these compounds, organic pigments displayed the broadest size range with smallest species preferentially reaching the lymph nodes.  Using synchrotron μ-FTIR analysis we were also able to detect ultrastructural changes of the tissue adjacent to tattoo particles through altered amide I α-helix to β-sheet protein ratios and elevated lipid contents.  Altogether we report strong evidence for both migration and long-term deposition of toxic elements and tattoo pigments as well as for conformational alterations of biomolecules that likely contribute to cutaneous inflammation and other adversities upon tattooing.\n",

      "Advances in nanotechnol. have raised concerns about possible effects of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in the environment, esp. in terrestrial plants.  In this research, the impacts of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were evaluated in hydroponically grown cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plants.  Seven day old seedlings were treated with TiO2 NPs at concns. varying from 0 to 4000 mg L-1.  At harvest, the size of roots and shoots were measured.  In addn., micro X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) and micro X-ray absorption spectroscopy (micro-XAS), resp., were used to track the presence and chem. speciation of Ti within plant tissues.  Results showed that at all concns., TiO2 significantly increased root length (av. >300%).  By using micro-XRF it was found that Ti was transported from the roots to the leaf trichomes, suggesting that trichomes are possible sink or excretory system for the Ti.  The micro-XANES spectra showed that the absorbed Ti was present as TiO2 within the cucumber tissues, demonstrating that the TiO2 NPs were not biotransformed.\n",

      "A REVIEW.  The increased use of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in com. products and the continuous development of novel applications, is leading to increased intentional and unintentional release of ENMs into the environment with potential neg. impacts.  Particularly, the partition of nanoparticles (NPs) to waste water treatment plant (WWTP) sludge represents a potential threat to agricultural ecosystems where these biosolids are being applied as fertilizers.  Moreover, several applications of ENMs in agriculture and soil remediation are suggested.  Therefore, detailed risk assessment should be done to evaluate possible secondary neg. impacts.  The impact of ENMS on plants as central component of ecosystems and worldwide food supply is of primary relevance.  Understanding the fate and phys. and chem. modifications of NPs in plants and their possible transfer into food chains requires specialized anal. techniques.  Due to the importance of both chem. and phys. factors to consider for a better understanding of ENMs behavior in complex matrixes, these materials can be considered a new type of analyte.  An ideal technique should require minimal sample prepn., be non-destructive, and offer the best balance between sensitivity, chem. specificity, and spatial resoln.  Synchrotron radiation (SR) techniques are particularly adapted to investigate localization and speciation of ENMs in plants.  SR X-ray fluorescence mapping (SR-XFM) offers multi-elemental detection with lateral resoln. down to the tens of nm, in combination with spatially resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) speciation.  This review will focus on important methodol. aspects regarding sample prepn., data acquisition and data anal. of SR-XFM/XAS to investigate interactions between plants and ENMs.\n",

      "Gold nanoparticles are excellent intracellular markers in X-ray imaging.  Having shown previously the suitability of gold nanoparticles to detect small groups of cells with the synchrotron-based computed tomography (CT) technique both ex vivo and in vivo, it is now demonstrated that even single-cell resolution can be obtained in the brain at least ex vivo.  Working in a small animal model of malignant brain tumour, the image quality obtained with different imaging modalities was compared.  To generate the brain tumour, 1 × 10(5) C6 glioma cells were loaded with gold nanoparticles and implanted in the right cerebral hemisphere of an adult rat.  Raw data were acquired with absorption X-ray CT followed by a local tomography technique based on synchrotron X-ray absorption yielding single-cell resolution.  The reconstructed synchrotron X-ray images were compared with images obtained by small animal magnetic resonance imaging.  The presence of gold nanoparticles in the tumour tissue was verified in histological sections.\n",

      "A review.  Thomson scattering sources with their hard x-ray pencil beams represent a promising candidate to drive high-resoln. X-ray Fluorescence Imaging (XFI).  As XFI is a scanning imaging modality, it specifically requires pencil-beam geometries along with a high beam mobility.  In combination with laser-wakefield acceleration (LWFA) such sources could provide the compactness needed for a future transition into clin. application.  A sufficient flux within a small bandwidth could enable in-vivo high-sensitivity XFI for early cancer diagnostics and pharmacokinetic imaging.  We thus report on a specific all-laser driven source design directed at increasing the photon no. within the bandwidth and opening angle defined by XFI conditions.  Typical parameters of driver lasers and electron bunches from LWFA are utilized and controlled within realistic parameter regions on the basis of appropriate beam optics.  An active plasma lens is implemented for chromatic focal control of the bunch.  Source performance limits are identified and compared to existing x-ray sources with regard to their potential to be implemented in future clin. XFI.\n",

      "FTIR imaging is a label-free, non-destructive method valuably exploited in the study of the biol. process in living cells.  However, the long wavelength/low spatial resoln. and the strong absorbance of water are still key constrains in the application of IR microscopy ex vivo.  In this work, a new retrofit approach based on the use of ZnS hemispheres is introduced to significantly improve the spatial resoln. on live cell FTIR imaging.  By means of two high refractive index domes sandwiching the sample, a lateral resoln. close to 2.2 μm at 6 μm wavelength has been achieved, i.e. below the theor. diffraction limit in air and more than twice the improvement (to ∼λ/2.7) from our previous attempt using CaF2 lenses.  The ZnS domes also allowed an extended spectral range to 950 cm-1, in contrast to the cut-off at 1050 cm-1 using CaF2.  In combination with synchrotron radiation source, microFTIR provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio through the circa 12 μm thin layer of medium, thus allowing detailed distribution of lipids, protein and nucleic acid in the surround of the nucleus of single living cells.  Endoplasmic reticula were clearly shown based on the lipid ν(CH) and ν(C=O) bands, while the DNA was imaged based on the ν(PO2-) band highlighting the nucleus region.  This work has also included a demonstration of drug (doxorubicin) in cell measurement to highlight the potential of this approach. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].\n",

      "Real-time chem. imaging of bacterial activities can facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of biofilm structures and functions.  Synchrotron-radiation-based Fourier transform IR (SR-FTIR) spectromicroscopy can yield high spatial resoln. and label-free vibrational signatures of chem. bonds in biomols., but the abundance of water in biofilms has hindered SR-FTIR's sensitivity in investigating bacterial activity.  The authors developed a simple open-channel microfluidic system that can circumvent the water-absorption barrier for chem. imaging of the developmental dynamics of bacterial biofilms with a spatial resoln. of several micrometers.  This system maintains a 10 μm thick laminar-flow-through biofilm system that minimizes both the imaging vol. in liq. and the signal interference from geometry-induced fringing.  Here the authors demonstrate the ability of the open-channel microfluidic platform to maintain the functionality of living cells while enabling high-quality SR-FTIR measurements.  The authors include several applications that show how microbes in biofilms adapt to their immediate environments.  The ability to directly monitor and map bacterial changes in biofilms can yield significant insight into a wide range of microbial systems, esp. when coupled to more sophisticated microfluidic platforms.\n",

      "Synchrotron radiation Fourier transform IR microspectroscopy (SR-microFTIR) of live biol. cells has the potential to provide far greater biochem. and morphol. detail than equiv. studies using dehydrated, chem.-fixed single cells.  Attempts to measure live cells using microFTIR are complicated by the aq. environment required and corresponding strong IR absorbance by water.  There is also the addnl. problem of the limited lifetime of the cells outside of their preferred culture environment.  In this work, the authors outline simple, cost-effective modifications to a com. available liq. sample holder to perform single live cell anal. under an IR microscope and demonstrate cell viability up to at least 24 h.  A study using this system in which live cells have been measured at increasing temp. has shown spectral changes in protein bands attributed to α-β transition, consistent with other published work, and proves the ability to simultaneously induce and measure biochem. changes.  An addnl. study of deuterated palmitic acid (D31-PA) uptake at different time points has made use of over 200 individual IR spectra collected over ∼4 h, taking advantage of the ability to maintain viable cell samples for longer periods of time in the measurement environment, and therefore acquire greatly increased nos. of spectra without compromising on spectral quality.  Further developments of this system are planned to widen the range of possible expts., and incorporate more complex studies, including drug-cell interaction.\n",

      "A review.  Protein misfolding and aggregation are the hallmark of a no. of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the prion diseases.  In all cases, a naturally-occurring protein misfolds and forms aggregates that are thought to disrupt cell function through a wide range of mechanisms that are yet to be fully unraveled.  Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique that is sensitive to the secondary structure of proteins and has been widely used to investigate the process of misfolding and aggregate formation.  This review focuses on how FTIR spectroscopy and spectroscopic microscopy are being used to evaluate the structural changes in disease-related proteins both in vitro and directly within cells and tissues.  Finally, ongoing technol. advances will be presented that are enabling time-resolved FTIR imaging of protein aggregation directly within living cells, which can provide insight into the structural intermediates, time scale, and mechanisms of cell toxicity assocd. with aggregate formation.\n",

      "Over the last few years, FTIR spectroscopy has become a potential anal. method in tissue and cell studies for cancer diagnosis.  This has opened a way towards clin. applications such as a tool that would scan samples to assess the presence or absence of malignant cells in biopsies, or as an aid to help pathologists to better characterize those cells that are suspicious but not diagnostic for cancer.  The latter application has the problem that in order to assess these cells pathologists would have already dealt with stained samples.  Therefore, it is important to understand how staining would affect the spectra of cells.  To this purpose, we have conducted this study in order to clarify, first, how haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Papanicolau (Pap) stainings affect the spectra of single cells and, second, whether FTIR spectroscopy could differentiate between stained lung cancer cells and their normal counterparts.  Furthermore, different cell prepns. (cytospin, and smear) used in cytol. diagnosis were assessed.  Expts. performed using a bright IR source (synchrotron) showed that both H&E and Pap staining induced marked changes in the lipid and amide-II band regions.  Despite this, FTIR spectroscopy of already stained cells is capable of differentiating between lung cancer cells and their normal counterparts.  The clin. applications of this methodol. are discussed.\n",

      "Small-animal physiology studies are typically complicated, but the level of complexity is greatly increased when performing live-animal X-ray imaging studies at synchrotron and compact light sources.  This group has extensive experience in these types of studies at the SPring-8 and Australian synchrotrons, as well as the Munich Compact Light Source.  These experimental settings produce unique challenges.  Experiments are always performed in an isolated radiation enclosure not specifically designed for live-animal imaging.  This requires equipment adapted to physiological monitoring and test-substance delivery, as well as shuttering to reduce the radiation dose.  Experiment designs must also take into account the fixed location, size and orientation of the X-ray beam.  This article describes the techniques developed to overcome the challenges involved in respiratory X-ray imaging of live animals at synchrotrons, now enabling increasingly sophisticated imaging protocols.\n",

      "The complexity of lung diseases makes pre-clin. in vivo respiratory research in mouse lungs of great importance for a better understanding of physiol. and therapeutic effects.  Synchrotron-based imaging has been successfully applied to lung research studies, however longitudinal studies can be difficult to perform due to limited facility access.  Lab.-based x-ray sources, such as inverse Compton x-ray sources, remove this access limitation and opens up new possibilities for pre-clin. small-animal lung research at high spatial and temporal resoln.  The in vivo visualization of drug deposition in mouse lungs is of interest, particularly in longitudinal research, because the therapeutic outcome is not only dependent on the delivered dose of the drug, but also on the spatial distribution of the drug.  An addnl. advantage of this approach, when compared to other imaging techniques, is that anat. and dynamic information is collected simultaneously.  Here we report the use of dynamic x-ray phase-contrast imaging to observe pulmonary drug delivery via liq. instillation, and by inhalation of micro-droplets.  Different liq. vols. (4 μl, 20 μl, 50 μl) were tested and a range of localized and global distributions were obsd. with a temporal resoln. of up to 1.5 fps.  The in vivo imaging results were confirmed by ex vivo x-ray and fluorescence imaging.  This ability to visualize pulmonary substance deposition in live small animals has provided a better understanding of the two key methods of delivery; instillation and nebulization.\n",

      "We describe the first dynamic and the first in vivo X-ray imaging studies successfully performed at a laser-undulator-based compact synchrotron light source.  The X-ray properties of this source enable time-sequence propagation-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging.  We focus here on non-invasive imaging for respiratory treatment development and physiological understanding.  In small animals, we capture the regional delivery of respiratory treatment, and two measures of respiratory health that can reveal the effectiveness of a treatment; lung motion and mucociliary clearance.  The results demonstrate the ability of this set-up to perform laboratory-based dynamic imaging, specifically in small animal models, and with the possibility of longitudinal studies.\n",

      "Advances in modern interface- and material sciences often rely on the understanding of a system's structure-function relationship.  Designing reproducible expts. that yield in situ time-resolved structural information at fast time scales is therefore of great interest, e.g., for better understanding the early stages of self-assembly or other phase transitions.  However, it can be challenging to accurately control exptl. conditions, esp. when samples are only available in small amts., prone to agglomeration, or if X-ray compatibility is required.  We address these challenges by presenting a microfluidic chip for triggering dynamics via rapid diffusive mixing for in situ time-resolved X-ray investigations.  This polyimide/Kapton-only-based device can be used to study the structural dynamics and phase transitions of a wide range of colloidal and soft matter samples down to millisecond time scales.  The novel multiangle laser ablation three-dimensional (3D) microstructuring approach combines, for the first time, the highly desirable characteristics of Kapton (high X-ray stability with low background, org. solvent compatibility) with a 3D flow-focusing geometry that minimizes mixing dispersion and wall agglomeration.  As a model system, to demonstrate the performance of these 3D Kapton microfluidic devices, we selected the non-solvent-induced self-assembly of biocompatible and amphiphilic diblock copolymers.  We then followed their structural evolution in situ at millisecond time scales using on-the-chip time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering under continuous-flow conditions.  Combined with complementary results from 3D finite-element method computational fluid dynamics simulations, we find that the nonsolvent mixing is mostly complete within a few tens of milliseconds, which triggers initial spherical micelle formation, while structural transitions into micelle lattices and their deswelling only occur on the hundreds of milliseconds to second time scale.  These results could have an important implication for the design and formulation of amphiphilic polymer nanoparticles for industrial applications and their use as drug-delivery systems in medicine.\n",

      "The hydrophobic collapse is a structural transition of grafted polymer chains in a poor solvent.  Although such a transition seems an intrinsic event during clustering of polymer-stabilized nanoparticles in the liq. phase, it has not been resolved in real time.  In this work, we implemented a microfluidic 3D-flow-focusing mixing reactor equipped with real-time analytics, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy to study the early stage of cluster formation for polystyrene-stabilized gold nanoparticles.  The polymer shell dynamics obtained by in situ SAXS anal. and numerical simulation of the solvent compn. allowed us to map the interaction energy between the particles at early state of solvent mixing, 30 ms behind the crossing point.  We found that the rate of hydrophobic collapse depends on water concn., ranging between 100 and 500 nm/s.  Importantly, we confirmed that the polymer shell collapses prior to the commencement of clustering.\n",

      "The microscopic insight into how and why catalytically active nanoparticles change their shape during oxidn. and redn. reactions is a pivotal challenge in the fundamental understanding of heterogeneous catalysis.  We report an oxygen-induced shape transformation of rhodium nanoparticles on magnesium oxide (001) substrates that is lifted upon carbon monoxide exposure at 600 K.  A Wulff anal. of high-resoln. in situ x-ray diffraction, combined with transmission electron microscopy, shows that this phenomenon is driven by the formation of a oxygen-rhodium-oxygen surface oxide at the rhodium nanofacets.  This exptl. access into the behavior of such nanoparticles during a catalytic cycle is useful for the development of improved heterogeneous catalysts.\n",

Here, we present x-ray diffraction data sensitive to the nanoparticle surface structure combined with in situ mass spectrometry during near ambient pressure CO oxidn.  We identify the formation of ultrathin surface oxides by detecting x-ray diffraction signals from particular nanoparticle facets and correlate their evolution with the sample's enhanced catalytic activity.  Our approach opens the door for an in-depth characterization of well-defined, oxide-supported nanoparticle based catalysts under operando conditions with unprecedented at.-scale resoln.\n",

      "We have studied the oxidn. of MgO(100) supported Pd nanoparticles in a size range from 4 to 24 nm at 570 K and near atm. pressures.  Our exptl. setup using high-energy x rays allows us to study in situ the oxidn. behavior for different particle sizes under identical exptl. conditions.  We can identify three size regimes with a distinct oxidn. mechanism.  For particles smaller than 5 nm in diam., kinetic barriers for bulk oxide formation are strongly reduced and complete transformation to PdO bulk oxide takes place, epitaxial to the MgO substrate.  Particles with a diam. 5 nm <D < 9 nm undergo continuous shrinkage during oxidn. accompanied by the formation of epitaxial PdO on MgO(100).  For larger particles with D > 9 nm, we observe a complete passivation of the particle surface by a thin polycryst. PdO layer, which prevents further oxidn.  Our expts. demonstrate that particles with a few nanometers in size exhibit a much higher reactivity with oxygen, which is important for the performance of Pd nanoparticles as a CO oxidn. catalyst.\n",

      "Nanoparticle sintering during catalytic reactions is a major cause for catalyst deactivation.  Understanding its at.-scale processes and finding strategies to reduce it is of paramount scientific and economic interest.  Here, we report on the compn.-dependent three-dimensional restructuring of epitaxial platinum-rhodium alloy nanoparticles on alumina during carbon monoxide oxidn. at 550 K and near-atm. pressures employing in situ high-energy grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, online mass spectrometry and a combinatorial sample design.  For platinum-rich particles our results disclose a dramatic reaction-induced height increase, accompanied by a corresponding redn. of the total particle surface coverage.  We find this restructuring to be progressively reduced for particles with increasing rhodium compn.  We explain our observations by a carbon monoxide oxidn. promoted non-classical Ostwald ripening process during which smaller particles are destabilized by the heat of reaction.  Its driving force lies in the initial particle shape which features for platinum-rich particles a kinetically stabilized, low aspect ratio.\n",

      "Using coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (CXDI) as an in situ tool, we detd. the shape and strain state of a platinum nanoparticle with ≈160 nm diam. supported by a strontium titanate substrate.  The expt. was performed at a temp. of 400 K under continuous gas flow conditions of pure Ar and Ar/CO mixts.  The nanoparticle was preselected by SEM (SEM) and postanalyzed by at. force microscopy (AFM).  We obtain a very good agreement between the overall nanoparticle size, shape, and defect structure as detd. by CXDI and AFM.  In addn., we compare the strain state in the nanoparticle near surface region and its bulk: For pure Ar flow, we find a slight compressive strain in the nanoparticle bulk compared to an expansion in the near surface region.  We ascribe the latter to the presence of high index vicinal surfaces.  Our anal. suggests that under mixed Ar/CO flow at 400 K reshaping of the nanoparticle occurred.  New high index facets developed, leading to a stronger lattice expansion, also propagating into the nanoparticle bulk.  Our high-resoln. expts. pave the way for future CXDI expts. under operando catalytic reaction conditions.\n",

      "Bimetallic catalysts can undergo segregation or redistribution of the metals driven by oxidizing and reducing environments.  Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) was used to relate displacement fields to compositional distributions in cryst. Pt-Rh alloy nanoparticles.  Three-dimensional images of internal compn. showed that the radial distribution of compns. reverses partially between the surface shell and the core when gas flow changes between O2 and H2.  Our observation suggests that the elemental segregation of nanoparticle catalysts should be highly active during heterogeneous catalysis and can be a controlling factor in synthesis of electrocatalysts.  In addn., our study exemplifies applications of BCDI for in situ 3D imaging of internal equil. compns. in other bimetallic alloy nanoparticles.\n",

      "Nanocryst. titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) is an important material used in commerce today.  When designed appropriately it can generate reactive species (RS) quite efficiently, particularly under UV illumination; this feature is exploited in applications ranging from self-cleaning glass to low-cost solar cells.  In this study, the authors characterize the toxicity of this important class of nanomaterials under ambient (e.g., no significant light illumination) conditions in cell culture.  Only at relatively high concns. (100 μg/mL) of nanoscale titania did the authors observe cytotoxicity and inflammation; these cellular responses exhibited classic dose-response behavior, and the effects increased with time of exposure.  The extent to which nanoscale titania affected cellular behavior was not dependent on sample surface area in this study; smaller nanoparticulate materials had effects comparable to larger nanoparticle materials.  What did correlate strongly to cytotoxicity, however, was the phase compn. of the nanoscale titania.  Anatase TiO2, for example, was 100 times more toxic than an equiv. sample of rutile TiO2.  The most cytotoxic nanoparticle samples were also the most effective at generating reactive oxygen species; ex vivo RS species generation under UV illumination correlated well with the obsd. biol. response.  These data suggest that nano-TiO2 samples optimized for RS prodn. in photocatalysis are also more likely to generate damaging RS species in cell culture.  The result highlights the important role that ex vivo measures of RS prodn. can play in developing screens for cytotoxicity.\n",

      "Cell lines were exposed either to mixts. of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles, or to a hybrid nanoparticle with gold and iron oxide domain.  In the case of simultaneous exposure to gold and iron oxide nanoparticles, enhanced toxicity as compared to the exposure to only one type of nanoparticles was obsd.  An indication was found that, at equiv. concns., the hybrid nanoparticles may slightly reduce cell viability more strongly than mixts. of both nanoparticle types.  The results suggest that composite nanomaterials, in which different materials are present in particle form, need to be analyzed carefully, as not only the concn. of the resp. but also their arrangement may influence their toxicity.\n",

      "Coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) has been widely applied in the physical and biological sciences using synchrotron radiation, X-ray free-electron laser, high harmonic generation, electrons, and optical lasers.  One of CDI's important applications is to probe dynamic phenomena with high spatiotemporal resolution.  Here, we report the development of a general in situ CDI method for real-time imaging of dynamic processes in solution.  By introducing a time-invariant overlapping region as real-space constraint, we simultaneously reconstructed a time series of complex exit wave of dynamic processes with robust and fast convergence.  We validated this method using optical laser experiments and numerical simulations with coherent X-rays.  Our numerical simulations further indicated that in situ CDI can potentially reduce radiation dose by more than an order of magnitude relative to conventional CDI.  With further development, we envision in situ CDI could be applied to probe a range of dynamic phenomena in the future.\n",

      "Colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) are a versatile potential platform for in vivo nanomedicine.  Inside blood circulation, NPs may undergo drastic changes, such as by formation of a protein corona.  The in vivo corona cannot be completely emulated by the corona formed in blood.  Thus, in situ detection in complex media, and ultimately in vivo, is required.  Here we present a methodology for determining protein corona formation in complex media.  NPs are labeled with (19)F and their diffusion coefficient measured using (19)F diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. (19)F diffusion NMR measurements of hydrodynamic radii allow for in situ characterization of NPs in complex environments by quantification of protein adsorption to the surface of NPs, as determined by increase in hydrodynamic radius.  The methodology is not optics based, and thus can be used in turbid environments, as in the presence of cells.\n",

      "We demonstrate the use of a molybdenum-anode-based inhouse small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) setup to study biol. macromols. in soln.  Our system consists of a microfocus X-ray tube delivering a highly collimated flux of 2.5 × 106 photons/s at a beam size of 1.2 × 1.2 mm2 at the collimation path exit and a max. beam divergence of 0.16 mrad.  The resulting observable scattering vectors q are in the range of 0.38 Å-1 down to 0.009 Å-1 in SAXS configuration and of 0.26 Å-1 up to 5.7 Å-1 in wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) mode.  To det. the capabilities of the instrument, we collected SAXS data on weakly scattering biol. macromols. including proteins and a nucleic acid sample with mol. wts. varying from ∼12 to 69 kDa and concns. of 1.5-24 mg/mL.  The measured scattering data display a high signal-to-noise ratio up to q-values of ∼0.2 Å-1 allowing for an accurate structural characterization of the samples.  Moreover, the inhouse source data are of sufficient quality to perform ab initio 3D structure reconstructions that are in excellent agreement with the available crystallog. structures.  In addn., measurements for the detergent decyl-maltoside show that the setup can be used to det. the size, shape, and interactions (as characterized by the second virial coeff.) of detergent micelles.  This demonstrates that the use of a Mo-anode based inhouse source is sufficient to det. basic geometric parameters and 3D shapes of biomols. and presents a viable alternative to valuable beam time at third generation synchrotron sources.

      "The local structural changes in amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP)-based dental composites were studied under isothermal conditions using both static, bulk measurement techniques and a recently developed methodol. based on combined ultra-small angle X-ray scattering-X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (USAXS-XPCS), which permits a dynamic approach.  While results from conventional bulk measurements do not show clear signs of structural change, USAXS-XPCS results reveal unambiguous evidence for local structural variations on a similar time scale to that of water loss in the ACP fillers.  A thermal-expansion-based simulation indicates that thermal behavior alone does not account for the obsd. dynamics.  Together, these results suggest that changes in the water content of ACP affect the composite morphol. due to changes in ACP structure that occur without an amorphous-to-cryst. conversion.  It is also noted that biomedical materials research could benefit greatly from USAXS-XPCS, a dynamic approach. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.  J Biomed Mater Res Part A: 2012.\n",

Expts. of this kind are usually considerably limited by strong beam attenuation due to interactions with the aq. environment.  First expts. at synchrotron sources using supported model membranes showed that the microfluidic setup yields a very effective soln. for minimizing background scattering and beam absorption, which are often accompanied by radiation damage of biol. samples.  Addnl., the setup is also well suited for the application of fluorescence microscopy.

      "Nanoparticles are known to self-assemble into larger structures through growth processes that typically occur continuously and depend on the uniformity of the individual nanoparticles.  Here, we show that inorg. nanoparticles with non-uniform size distributions can spontaneously assemble into uniformly sized supraparticles with core-shell morphologies.  This self-limiting growth process is governed by a balance between electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals attraction, which is aided by the broad polydispersity of the nanoparticles.  The generic nature of the interactions creates flexibility in the compn., size and shape of the constituent nanoparticles, and leads to a large family of self-assembled structures, including hierarchically organized colloidal crystals.\n",

      "The hydrophobic collapse is a structural transition of grafted polymer chains in a poor solvent.  Although such a transition seems an intrinsic event during clustering of polymer-stabilized nanoparticles in the liq. phase, it has not been resolved in real time.  In this work, we implemented a microfluidic 3D-flow-focusing mixing reactor equipped with real-time analytics, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy to study the early stage of cluster formation for polystyrene-stabilized gold nanoparticles.  The polymer shell dynamics obtained by in situ SAXS anal. and numerical simulation of the solvent compn. allowed us to map the interaction energy between the particles at early state of solvent mixing, 30 ms behind the crossing point.  We found that the rate of hydrophobic collapse depends on water concn., ranging between 100 and 500 nm/s.  Importantly, we confirmed that the polymer shell collapses prior to the commencement of clustering.\n",

      "Finding a synthetic pathway to artificial analogs of nacre and bones represents a fundamental milestone in the development of composite materials.  The ordered brick-and-mortar arrangement of org. and inorg. layers is believed to be the most essential strength- and toughness-detg. structural feature of nacre.  It has also been found that the ionic crosslinking of tightly folded macromols. is equally important.  Here, we demonstrate that both structural features can be reproduced by sequential deposition of polyelectrolytes and clays.  This simple process results in a nanoscale version of nacre with alternating org. and inorg. layers.  The macromol. folding effect reveals itself in the unique saw-tooth pattern of differential stretching curves attributed to the gradual breakage of ionic crosslinks in polyelectrolyte chains.  The tensile strength of the prepd. multilayers approached that of nacre, whereas their ultimate Young modulus was similar to that of lamellar bones.  Structural and functional resemblance makes clay- polyelectrolyte multilayers a close replica of natural biocomposites.  Their nanoscale nature enables elucidation of mol. processes occurring under stress.\n",

      "Nacre-like composites have been investigated typically in the form of coatings or free-standing sheets.  They demonstrated remarkable mech. properties and are used as ultrastrong materials but macroscale fibers with nacre-like organization can improve mech. properties even further.  The fiber form or nacre can, simplify manufg. and offer new functional properties unknown yet for other forms of biomimetic materials.  Here we demonstrate that nacre-like fibers can be produced by shear-induced self-assembly of nanoplatelets.  The synergy between two structural motifs-nanoscale brick-and-mortar stacking of platelets and microscale twisting of the fibers-gives rise to high stretchability (>400%) and gravimetric toughness (640 J g-1).  These unique mech. properties originate from the multiscale deformation regime involving solid-state self-organization processes that lead to efficient energy dissipation.  Incorporating luminescent CdTe nanowires into these fibers imparts the new property of mech. tunable circularly polarized luminescence.  The nacre-like fibers open a novel technol. space for optomechanics of biomimetic composites, while their continuous spinning methodol. makes scalable prodn. realistic.\n",

      "Nature is remarkable at tailoring the chirality of different biomols. to suit specific functions.  Chiral mols. can impart optical activity to achiral materials in the form of the particle's electronic transition frequency.  Herein, the authors used peptides of differing secondary structures (random coil and α-helix) to artificially create optically active chiral gold nanoparticles through peptide-nanoparticle interactions as obsd. by CD spectroscopy.  This interaction produces a CD signal at the plasmon resonance frequency (∼520 nm) of the chiral peptide-nanoparticle complex.  Aggregation of the peptide-coated nanoparticles using metal ions results in a red-shifted plasmonic CD response.  The authors' results suggest that chiroptical properties of nanomaterials can be engineered using peptides.\n",

      "Wide-spread applications of nanoparticles require large-scale fabrication techniques.  Being intrinsically scalable, bottom-up nanoparticle synthesis shows an ever-growing control over particle morphol., enabling even chirally selective shapes.  Significant efforts have been undertaken to refine the synthesis in order to decrease the structural spread of the particles and to purify and maximize the resulting handedness.  So far, imaging technologies such as electron microscopy are mostly used to investigate the quality of the synthesis.  However, for nanophotonic and plasmonic applications, the optical properties are, in fact, key.  In this work, we show that single particle chiral scatterometry holds great potential as a feedback to characterize the (chir-)optical quality of chem. synthesized nanoparticles.  The spectra of single helicoid nanoparticles reveal a diverse set of chiroptical responses with hugely varying abs. chiral asymmetry in spite of the well-controlled morphol. of the particles.  Averaging over the single nanoparticles reproduces the soln. ensemble measurement remarkably well.  This demonstrates that the single particles, despite their morphol. and consequently chiroptical differences, exhibit a clearly pronounced chiral spectral and structural feature.  We find that the g-factor, i.e., the degree of asymmetry of chiral light scattering of single nanoparticles can be up to 4 times larger than that for the ensemble.  This proves that chiral scatterometry can be a highly important optical feedback for bottom-up nanoparticle synthesis as it reveals that the asymmetry of the ensemble soln. can be further increased and maximized by appropriate refinement methods or by postfabrication purifn.\n",

Herein, chiral GSH-anchored selenium nanoparticles (G@SeNPs) are fabricated to investigate the effect of their chirality on their transport and antioxidant activity.  G@SeNPs modified with different enantiomers show opposite handedness with a tunable CD signal.  Noninvasive positron emission tomog. imaging clearly reveals that 64Cu-labeled L-G@SeNPs experience distinctly different transport among the major organs from that of their D-and DL-counterparts, demonstrating that the chirality of the G@SeNPs influences the biodistribution and kinetics.

      "Nanoscale biological assemblies exemplified by exosomes, endosomes and capsids, play crucial roles in all living systems.  Supraparticles (SP) from inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) replicate structural characteristics of these bioassemblies, but it is unknown whether they can mimic their biochemical functions.  Here, we show that chiral ZnS NPs self-assemble into 70-100 nm SPs that display sub-nanoscale porosity associated with interstitial spaces between constituent NPs.  Similarly to photosynthetic bacterial organelles, these SPs can serve as photocatalysts, enantioselectively converting L- or D-tyrosine (Tyr) into dityrosine (diTyr).  Experimental data and molecular dynamic simulations indicate that the chiral bias of the photocatalytic reaction is associated with the chiral environment of interstitial spaces and preferential partitioning of enantiomers into SPs, which can be further enhanced by co-assembling ZnS with Au NPs.  Besides replicating a specific function of biological nanoassemblies, these findings establish a path to enantioselective oxidative coupling of phenols for biomedical and other needs.\n",

      "Semiconductors with chiral geometries at the nanoscale and mesoscale provide a rich materials platform for polarization optics, photocatalysis, and biomimetics.  Unlike metallic and org. optical materials, the relationship between the geometry of chiral semiconductors and their chiroptical properties remains, however, vague.  Homochiral ensembles of semiconductor helixes with defined geometries open the road to understanding complex relationships between geometrical parameters and chiroptical properties of semiconductor materials.  We show that semiconductor helixes can be prepd. with an abs. yield of ca 0.1% and an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 98% or above from cysteine-stabilized cadmium telluride nanoparticles (CdTe NPs) dispersed in methanol.  This high e.e. for a spontaneously occurring chem. process is attributed to chiral self-sorting based on the thermodn. preference of NPs to assemble with those of the same handedness.  The dispersions of homochiral self-assembled helixes display broadband visible and nearinfrared (Vis-NIR) polarization rotation with anisotropy (g) factors approaching 0.01.  Calcd. CD (CD) spectra accurately reproduced exptl. CD spectra and gave exptl. validated spectral predictions for different geometrical parameters enabling de novo design of chiroptical semiconductor materials.  Unlike metallic, ceramic, and polymeric helixes that serve predominantly as scatterers, chiroptical properties of semiconductor helixes have nearly equal contribution of light absorption and scattering, which is essential for device-oriented, field-driven light modulation.  Deconstruction of a helix into a series of nanorods provides a simple model for the light-matter interaction and chiroptical activity of helixes.  This study creates a framework for further development of polarization based optics toward biomedical applications, telecommunications, and hyperspectral imaging.\n",

      "The intra- and extracellular positioning of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) can dramatically alter their curative/diagnostic abilities and medical outcomes.  However, the inability of common spectroscopic identifiers to register the events of transmembrane transport denies their intracellular vs. extracellular localization even for cell cultures.  Here we show that the chiroptical activity of DNA-bridged NP dimers allows one to follow the process of internalization of the particles by the mammalian cells and to distinguish their extra- vs intra-cellular localizations by real-time spectroscopy in ensemble.  Circular dichroism peaks in the visible range change from negative to positive during transmembrane transport.  The chirality reversal is associated with a spontaneous twisting motion around the DNA bridge caused by the large change in electrostatic repulsion between NPs when the dimers move from interstitial fluid to cytosol.  This finding opens the door for spectroscopic targeting of plasmonic nanodrugs and quantitative assessment of nanoscale interactions.  The efficacy of dichroic targeting of chiral nanostructures for biomedical applications is exemplified here as photodynamic therapy of malignancies.  The efficacy of cervical cancer cell elimination was drastically increased when circular polarization of incident photons matched to the preferential absorption of dimers localized inside the cancer cells, which is associated with the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and their preferential intracellular localization.\n",

      "Chiral self-assembled nanomaterials with biol. applications have attracted great interest.  In this study, DNA-driven gold-upconversion nanoparticle (Au-UCNP) pyramids were fabricated to detect intracellular microRNA (miRNA) in real time.  The Au-UCNP pyramids are doubly optically active, displaying strong plasmonic CD at 521 nm and significant luminescence in 500-600 nm, and therefore can be monitored by both of them.  CD will decrease while the luminescence intensity increases in the presence of miRNA.  The exptl. results show that the CD intensity had an outstanding linear range from 0.073 to 43.65 fmol/10 μgRNA and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.03 fmol/10 μgRNA, whereas the luminescence intensity ranged from 0.16 to 43.65 fmol/10 μgRNA with a LOD of 0.12 fmol/10 μgRNA.  These data indicate that the CD signal is much more sensitive to the concn. of miRNA than the luminescent signal, which is attributed to the strong CD intensity arising from the spin angular momentum of the photon interaction with chiral nanostructures and the plasmonic enhancement of the intrinsic chirality of DNA mols. in the pyramids.  This approach opens up a new avenue to the ultrasensitive detection and quantification of miRNA in living cells.\n",

      "The interactions between chiral nanomaterials and organisms are still challenging and mysterious.  Here, a chiral nanodevice made of yolk-shell nanoparticles tetrahedron (UYTe), centralized with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), was fabricated to induce autophagy in vivo.  The proposed chiral nanodevice displayed a tunable circular dichroism (CD) signal when modified with different enantiomers of glutathione (GSH).  Notably, UYTe showed significant chirality-dependent autophagy-inducing ability after D-GSH-modification because the enhanced oxidative stress and accumulation in living cell.  The activation of autophagy resulted in the reduced intracellular CD intensity from the disassembly of the structure.  The intracellular ATP concentration was simultaneously enhanced in response to autophagy activity, which was quantitatively bio-imaged with the upconversion luminescence (UCL) signal of the UCNP that escaped from UYTe.  The autophagy effect induced in vivo by the chiral UYTe was also visualized with UCL imaging, demonstrating the great potential utility of the chiral nanostructure for cellular biological applications.\n",

      "A review.  Conspectus: Chirality in Nature can be found across all length scales, from the subat. to the galactic.  At the mol. scale, the spatial dissymmetry in the at. arrangements of pairs of mirror-image mols., known as enantiomers, gives rise to fascinating and often crit. differences in chem. and phys. properties.  With increasing hierarchical complexity, protein function, cell communication, and organism health rely on enantioselective interactions between mols. with selective handedness.  For example, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases have been linked to distortion of chiral-mol. structure.  Moreover, D-amino acids have become increasingly recognized as potential biomarkers, necessitating comprehensive anal. methods for diagnosis that are capable of distinguishing L- from D-forms and quantifying trace concns. of D-amino acids.  Correspondingly, many pharmaceuticals and agrochems. consist of chiral mols. that target particular enantioselective pathways.  Yet, despite the importance of mol. chirality, it remains challenging to sense and to sep. chiral compds.  Chiral-optical spectroscopies are designed to analyze the purity of chiral samples, but they are often insensitive to the trace enantiomeric excess that might be present in a patient sample, such as blood, urine, or sputum, or pharmaceutical product.  Similarly, existing sepn. schemes to enable enantiopure solns. of chiral products are inefficient or costly.  Consequently, most pharmaceuticals or agrochems. are sold as racemic mixts., with reduced efficacy and potential deleterious impacts.  Recent advances in nanophotonics lay the foundation toward highly sensitive and efficient chiral detection and sepn. methods.  In this Account, we highlight our group's effort to leverage nanoscale chiral light-matter interactions to detect, characterize, and sep. enantiomers, potentially down to the single mol. level.  Notably, certain resonant nanostructures can significantly enhance CD for improved chiral sensing and spectroscopy as well as high-yield enantioselective photochem.  We first describe how achiral metallic and dielec. nanostructures can be utilized to increase the local optical chirality d. by engineering the coupling between elec. and magnetic optical resonances.  While plasmonic nanoparticles locally enhance the optical chirality d., high-index dielec. nanoparticles can enable large-vol. and uniform-sign enhancements in the optical chirality d.  By overlapping these elec. and magnetic resonances, local chiral fields can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude.  We show how these design rules can enable high-yield enantioselective photochem. and project a 2000-fold improvement in the yield of a photoionization reaction.  Next, we discuss how optical forces can enable selective manipulation and sepn. of enantiomers.  We describe the design of low-power enantioselective optical tweezers with the ability to trap sub-10 nm dielec. particles.  We also characterize their chiral-optical forces with high spatial and force resoln. using combined optical and at. force microscopy.  These optical tweezers exhibit an enantioselective optical force contrast exceeding 10 pN, enabling selective attraction or repulsion of enantiomers based on the illumination polarization.  Finally, we discuss future challenges and opportunities spanning fundamental research to technol. translation.  Disease detection in the clinic as well as pharmaceutical and agrochem. industrial applications requiring large-scale, high-throughput prodn. will gain particular benefit from the simplicity and relative low cost that nanophotonic platforms promise.\n",

      "Surfactant-assisted seeded growth of metal nanoparticles (NPs) can be engineered to produce anisotropic gold nanocrystals with high chiroptical activity through the templating effect of chiral micelles formed in the presence of dissym. cosurfactants.  Mixed micelles adsorb on gold nanorods, forming quasihelical patterns that direct seeded growth into NPs with pronounced morphol. and optical handedness.  Sharp chiral wrinkles lead to chiral plasmon modes with high dissymmetry factors (∼0.20).  Through variation of the dimensions of chiral wrinkles, the chiroptical properties can be tuned within the visible and near-IR electromagnetic spectrum.  The micelle-directed mechanism allows extension to other systems, such as the seeded growth of chiral platinum shells on gold nanorods.  This approach provides a reproducible, simple, and scalable method toward the fabrication of NPs with high chiral optical activity.\n",

      "Chirality at the nanometer scale represents one of the most rapidly developing areas of research.  Self-assembly of DNA-nanoparticle (NP) hybrids enables geometrically precise assembly of chiral isomers.  The concept of a discrete chiral nanostructure of tetrahedral shape and topol. fabricated from 4 different NPs located in the corners of the pyramid is fundamental to the field.  While the 1st observations of optical activity of mixed pyramidal assemblies were made in 2009 (Chen, W.; Nano Lett.2009, , 2153-2159), further studies are difficult without finely resolved optical data for precisely organized NP pyramidal enantiomers.  Here the authors describe the prepn. of a family of self-assembled chiral pyramids made from multiple metal and/or semiconductor NPs with a yield ≤80%.  Purposefully made R- and S-enantiomers of chiral pyramids with 4 different NPs from 3 different materials displayed strong chiroptical activity, with anisotropy g-factors ≤1.9 × 10-2 in the visible spectral range.  Importantly, all NP constituents contribute to the chiroptical activity of the R/S pyramids.  The authors were able to observe 3 different CD signals at 350-550 nm simultaneously.  They correspond to the plasmonic oscillations of Au, Ag, and bandgap transitions of quantum dots.  Tunability of chiroptical bands related to these transitions is essential from fundamental and practical points of view.  The predictability of optical properties of pyramids, the simplicity of their self-assembly in comparison with lithog., and the possibility for polymerase chain reaction-based automation of their synthesis are expected to facilitate their future applications.\n",

      "The emergence of chirality is a central issue in chem., materials science, and biol.  In nanoparticle assemblies, chirality has been shown to arise through a few different processes, but chiral organizations composed of plate-like nanoparticles, a class of material under scrutiny due to their wide applicative potential, have not yet been reported.  We show that ribbons of stacked board-shaped cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanoplatelets (NPLs) twist upon the addn. of oleic acid ligand, leading to chiral ribbons that reach several micrometers in length and display a well-defined pitch of ∼400 nm.  We demonstrate that the chirality originates from surface strain caused by the ligand because isolated NPLs in dil. soln. undergo a transition from a flat to a twisted shape as the ligand coverage increases.  When the platelets are closely stacked within ribbons, the individual twist propagates over the whole ribbon length.  These results show that a ligand-induced mech. stress can strongly distort thin NPLs and that this stress can be expressed at a larger scale, paving the way to stress engineering in assemblies of nanocrystals.  Such a structural change resulting from a simple external stimulus could have broad implications for the design of sensors and other responsive materials.\n",

      "The structural complexity of composite biomaterials and biomineralized particles arises from the hierarchical ordering of inorg. building blocks over multiple scales.  Although empirical observations of complex nanoassemblies are abundant, the physicochem. mechanisms leading to their geometrical complexity are still puzzling, esp. for nonuniformly sized components.  We report the self-assembly of hierarchically organized particles (HOPs) from polydisperse gold thiolate nanoplatelets with cysteine surface ligands.  Graph theory methods indicate that these HOPs, which feature twisted spikes and other morphologies, display higher complexity than their biol. counterparts.  Their intricate organization emerges from competing chirality-dependent assembly restrictions that render assembly pathways primarily dependent on nanoparticle symmetry rather than size.  These findings and HOP phase diagrams open a pathway to a large family of colloids with complex architectures and unusual chiroptical and chem. properties.\n",

      "The effect of chem.-compn. modification on the chiroptical property of chiral org. NH4+ cation-contg. org. inorg. hybrid perovskite (chiral OIHP) is studied.  Varying the mixing ratio of bromide and iodide anions in S- or (R-C6H5CH2MeNH3)2PbI4(1-x)Br4x modifies the band gap of chiral OIHP, leading to a shift of the CD signal from 495 to 474 nm.  An abrupt cryst. structure transition occurs, and the CD signal is turned off when iodide-determinant phases are transformed into the bromide-determinant phase.  To obtain CD in the wavelength range where the bromide-determinant phase is supposed to exhibit chiroptical activity, i.e., <474 nm, S- or R-C12H7CH2MeNH3 with a larger spacer group can be adopted; the CD signal can be further blue-shifted to ∼375 nm.  Here, chem.-compn. modification of chiral OIHP affects the chiroptical properties of chiral OIHP in 2 ways: (1) tuning the wavelength of CD by modulating the excitonic band structure and (2) switching the CD on and off by inducing a cryst.-structure change.  These properties can be used for structural engineering of high-performance chiroptical materials for spin-polarized light-emitting devices and polarization-based optoelectronics.\n",

      "X-ray scanning microscopy relies on intensive nanobeams generated by imaging a highly brilliant synchrotron radiation source onto the sample with a nanofocusing X-ray optic.  Here, using a Gaussian model for the central cone of an undulator source, the nanobeam generated by refractive X-ray lenses is modeled in terms of size, flux and coherence.  The beam properties are expressed in terms of the emittances of the storage ring and the lateral sizes of the electron beam.  Optimal source parameters are calculated to obtain efficient and diffraction-limited nanofocusing.  With decreasing emittance, the usable fraction of the beam for diffraction-limited nanofocusing experiments can be increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared with modern storage ring sources.  For a diffraction-limited storage ring, nearly the whole beam can be focused, making these sources highly attractive for X-ray scanning microscopy.\n",

      "Structural studies in general, and crystallog. in particular, have benefited and still do benefit dramatically from the use of synchrotron radiation.  Low-emittance storage rings of the third generation provide focused beams down to the micrometre range that are sufficiently intense for the investigation of weakly scattering crystals down to the size of several micrometres.  Even though the coherent fraction of these sources is below 1%, a no. of new imaging techniques have been developed to exploit the partially coherent radiation.  However, many techniques in nanoscience are limited by this rather small coherent fraction.  On the one hand, this restriction limits the ability to study the structure and dynamics of non-cryst. materials by methods that depend on the coherence properties of the beam, like coherent diffractive imaging and X-ray correlation spectroscopy.  On the other hand, the flux in an ultra-small diffraction-limited focus is limited as well for the same reason.  Meanwhile, new storage rings with more advanced lattice designs are under construction or under consideration, which will have significantly smaller emittances.  These sources are targeted towards the diffraction limit in the X-ray regime and will provide roughly one to two orders of magnitude higher spectral brightness and coherence.  They will be esp. suited to expts. exploiting the coherence properties of the beams and to ultra-small focal spot sizes in the regime of several nanometers.  Although the length of individual X-ray pulses at a storage-ring source is of the order of 100 ps, which is sufficiently short to track structural changes of larger groups, faster processes as they occur during vision or photosynthesis, for example, are not accessible in all details under these conditions.  Linear accelerator (linac) driven free-electron laser (FEL) sources with extremely short and intense pulses of very high coherence circumvent some of the limitations of present-day storage-ring sources.  It has been demonstrated that their individual pulses are short enough to outrun radiation damage for single-pulse exposures.  These ultra-short pulses also enable time-resolved studies 1000 times faster than at std. storage-ring sources.  Developments are ongoing at various places for a totally new type of X-ray source combining a linac with a storage ring.  These energy-recovery linacs promise to provide pulses almost as short as a FEL, with brilliances and multi-user capabilities comparable with a diffraction-limited storage ring.  Altogether, these new X-ray source developments will provide smaller and more intense X-ray beams with a considerably higher coherent fraction, enabling a broad spectrum of new techniques for studying the structure of cryst. and non-cryst. states of matter at at. length scales.  In addn., the short X-ray pulses of FELs will enable the study of fast at. dynamics and non-equil. states of matter.\n",

      "The PETRA IV project aims at upgrading the present synchrotron radiation source PETRA III at DESY into an ultralow-emittance source.  Being diffraction limited up to X-rays of about 10 keV, PETRA IV will be ideal for three-dimensional X-ray microscopy of biol., chem. and phys. processes under realistic conditions at length scales from at. dimensions to millimetres and time scales down to the sub-nanosecond regime.  In this way, it will enable groundbreaking studies in many fields of science and industry, such as health, energy, earth and environment, mobility and information technol.  The science case is reviewed and the current state of the conceptual design is summarized, discussing a ref. lattice, a hybrid multi-bend achromat with an interleaved sextupole configuration based on the ESRF-EBS design, in more detail as well as alternative lattice concepts.\n",

      "The last decade has seen a renaissance of machine-physics studies and technological advancements that aim to upgrade at least 15 synchrotron light sources worldwide to diffraction-limited storage rings.  This is expected to improve the average spectral brightness and transversally coherent fraction of photons by several orders of magnitude in the soft- and hard-X-ray wavelength range, at the expense of pulse durations longer than ∼80 ps FWHM.  This paper discusses the compatibility of schemes for the generation of sub-picosecond photon-pulse durations in synchrotron light sources with standard multi-bunch user operation and, in particular, diffraction-limited electron optics design.  The question of this compatibility is answered taking into consideration the storage ring beam energy and the constraint of existing synchrotrons' infrastructure.  An alternative scheme for the upgrade of medium-energy synchrotron light sources to diffraction-limited storage rings and the simultaneous production of picosecond-long photon pulses in a high-gain free-electron laser scheme are illustrated.\n",

      "It has been known for decades that the emittance of multi-GeV storage rings can be reduced to very small values using multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattices.  However, a practical design of a ring having emittance approaching the diffraction limit for multi-keV photons, i.e. a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR), with a circumference of order 1 km or less was not possible before the development of small-aperture vacuum systems and other accelerator technology, together with an evolution in the understanding and accurate simulation of non-linear beam dynamics, had taken place.  The 3-GeV MAX IV project in Sweden has initiated a new era of MBA storage ring light source design, i.e. a fourth generation, with the Sirius project in Brazil now following suit, each having an order of magnitude smaller horizontal emittance than third-generation machines.  The ESRF, APS and SPring-8 are all exploring 6-GeV MBA lattice conversions in the imminent future while China is considering a similar-energy green-field machine.  Other lower-energy facilities, including the ALS, SLS, Soleil, Diamond and others, are studying the possibility of such conversions.  Future larger-circumference rings, possibly housed in >2-km tunnels made available by decommissioned high-energy physics accelerators, could have sub-10-pm-rad emittances, providing very high coherence for >10-keV X-rays.  A review of fourth-generation ring design concepts and plans in the world is presented.\n",

      "This article summarizes the contributions in this special issue on Diffraction-Limited Storage Rings.  It analyses the progress in accelerator technol. enabling a significant increase in brightness and coherent fraction of the X-ray light provided by storage rings.  With MAX IV and Sirius there are two facilities under construction that already exploit these advantages.  Several other projects are in the design stage and these will probably enhance the performance further.  To translate the progress in light source quality into new science requires similar progress in aspects such as optics, beamline technol., detectors and data anal.  The quality of new science will be limited by the weakest component in this value chain.  Breakthroughs can be expected in high-resoln. imaging, microscopy and spectroscopy.  These techniques are relevant for many fields of science; for example, for the fundamental understanding of the properties of correlated electron materials, the development and characterization of materials for data and energy storage, environmental applications and bio-medicine.\n",

      "In this paper, the fundamental concepts and equations necessary for performing small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and MD-SAXS analyses were reviewed.  Furthermore, several key biological and non-biological applications for SAXS, MD, and MD-SAXS are presented in this review; however, this article does not cover all possible applications.  SAXS is an experimental technique used for the analysis of a wide variety of biological and non-biological structures.  SAXS utilizes spherical averaging to produce one- or two-dimensional intensity profiles, from which structural data may be extracted.  MD simulation is a computer simulation technique that is used to model complex biological and non-biological systems at the atomic level.  MD simulations apply classical Newtonian mechanics' equations of motion to perform force calculations and to predict the theoretical physical properties of the system.  This review presents several applications that highlight the ability of both SAXS and MD to study protein folding and function in addition to non-biological applications, such as the study of mechanical, electrical, and structural properties of non-biological nanoparticles.  Lastly, the potential benefits of combining SAXS and MD simulations for the study of both biological and non-biological systems are demonstrated through the presentation of several examples that combine the two techniques.\n",

      "Many biol. materials, like bone or wood, are hierarchically organized and optimized at all levels for their specific mech. function.  At the lowest level, these materials are fiber composites, where the fiber direction as well as the size of the individual components varies considerably with position inside a given specimen.  For bone or wood, some of these parameters can be readily obtained by small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) in a position-resolved way.  A scanning-SAXS system based on a pinhole camera with rotating anode and area detector is presented, and first applications to the study of bone and wood are reported.\n",

      "The authors demonstrate a novel, synthetic approach, highly inspired by the architecture of natural bone, to design mech. stable nanocomposites incorporating aligned apatite nanocrystals.  To mimic the nanostructure of natural bone, the authors first combine mol. self-assembly and intermol. crosslinking to creat resilient polymeric matrixes with long-range periodicity; then the authors employ compartmentalized mineral growth via a transient amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) phase for the biomimetic formation of bone-like apatites.  Specifically, Pluronic F127 was modified into its diacrylate deriv. (MF127) so the assembled liq. crystal structures can be chem. crosslinked to form polymd. lquid crystal (PLC).  Expts. showed both the PLC matrix and the composite were degradable, which makes them appealing platforms for designing advanced materials for biomedical applications.\n",

      "A scanning X-ray diffraction study of cardiac tissue has been performed, covering the entire cross section of a mouse heart slice.  To this end, moderate focusing by compd. refractive lenses to micrometer spot size, continuous scanning, data acquisition by a fast single-photon-counting pixel detector, and fully automated anal. scripts have been combined.  It was shown that a surprising amt. of structural data can be harvested from such a scan, evaluating the local scattering intensity, interfilament spacing of the muscle tissue, the filament orientation, and the degree of anisotropy.  The workflow of data anal. is described and a data anal. toolbox with example data for general use is provided.  Since many cardiomyopathies rely on the structural integrity of the sarcomere, the contractile unit of cardiac muscle cells, the present study can be easily extended to characterize tissue from a diseased heart.\n",

      "We demonstrate high-resolution small-angle x-ray scattering computed tomography (SAXS-CT) of soft matter and soft tissue samples.  Complete SAXS patterns over extended ranges of momentum transfer are reconstructed spatially resolved from volumes inside an extended sample.  Several SAXS standard samples are used to quantitatively validate the method and demonstrate its performance.  Further results on biomedical tissue samples (rat brains) are presented that demonstrate the advantages of the method compared to existing biomedical x-ray imaging approaches.  Functional areas of the brains as well as tumor morphology are imaged.  By providing insights into the structural organization at the nano-level, SAXS-CT complements and extends results obtainable with standard methods such as x-ray absorption tomography and histology.\n",

      "When used in combination with raster scanning, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has proven to be a valuable imaging technique of the nanoscale, for example of bone, teeth and brain matter.  Although two-dimensional projection imaging has been used to characterize various materials successfully, its three-dimensional extension, SAXS computed tomog., poses substantial challenges, which have yet to be overcome.  Previous work using SAXS computed tomog. was unable to preserve oriented SAXS signals during reconstruction.  Here we present a soln. to this problem and obtain a complete SAXS computed tomog., which preserves oriented scattering information.  By introducing virtual tomog. axes, we take advantage of the two-dimensional SAXS information recorded on an area detector and use it to reconstruct the full three-dimensional scattering distribution in reciprocal space for each voxel of the three-dimensional object in real space.  The presented method could be of interest for a combined six-dimensional real and reciprocal space characterization of mesoscopic materials with hierarchically structured features with length scales ranging from a few nanometers to a few millimeters-for example, biomaterials such as bone or teeth, or functional materials such as fuel-cell or battery components.\n",

      "The mech. properties of many materials are based on the macroscopic arrangement and orientation of their nanostructure.  This nanostructure can be ordered over a range of length scales.  In biol., the principle of hierarchical ordering is often used to maximize functionality, such as strength and robustness of the material, while minimizing wt. and energy cost.  Methods for nanoscale imaging provide direct visual access to the ultrastructure (nanoscale structure that is too small to be imaged using light microscopy), but the field of view is limited and does not easily allow a full correlative study of changes in the ultrastructure over a macroscopic sample.  Other methods of probing ultrastructure ordering, such as small-angle scattering of X-rays or neutrons, can be applied to macroscopic samples; however, these scattering methods remain constrained to two-dimensional specimens or to isotropically oriented ultrastructures.  These constraints limit the use of these methods for studying nanostructures with more complex orientation patterns, which are abundant in nature and materials science.  Here, we introduce an imaging method that combines small-angle scattering with tensor tomog. to probe nanoscale structures in three-dimensional macroscopic samples in a non-destructive way.  We demonstrate the method by measuring the main orientation and the degree of orientation of nanoscale mineralized collagen fibrils in a human trabecula bone sample with a spatial resoln. of 25 μm.  Symmetries within the sample, such as the cylindrical symmetry commonly obsd. for mineralized collagen fibrils in bone, allow for tractable sampling requirements and numerical efficiency.  Small-angle scattering tensor tomog. is applicable to both biol. and materials science specimens, and may be useful for understanding and characterizing smart or bio-inspired materials.  Moreover, because the method is non-destructive, it is appropriate for in situ measurements and allows, for example, the role of ultrastructure in the mech. response of a biol. tissue or manufd. material to be studied.\n",

      "Small-angle X-ray scattering tensor tomog., which allows reconstruction of the local three-dimensional reciprocal-space map within a three-dimensional sample as introduced by Liebi et al. [Nature (2015), 527, 349-352], is described in more detail with regard to the math. framework and the optimization algorithm.  For the case of trabecular bone samples from vertebrae it is shown that the model of the three-dimensional reciprocal-space map using spherical harmonics can adequately describe the measured data.  The method enables the detn. of nanostructure orientation and degree of orientation as demonstrated previously in a single momentum transfer q range.  This article presents a reconstruction of the complete reciprocal-space map for the case of bone over extended ranges of q.  In addn., it is shown that uniform angular sampling and advanced regularization strategies help to reduce the amt. of data required.\n",

      "SAXS-CT is an emerging powerful imaging technique which bridges the gap between information retrieved from high-resolution local techniques and information from low-resolution, large field-of-view imaging, to determine the nanostructure characteristics of well-ordered tissues, e.g., mineralized collagen in bone.  However, in the case of soft tissues, features such as poor nanostructural organization and high susceptibility to radiation-induced damage limit the use of SAXS-CT.  Here, by combining the freeze-drying the specimen, preceded by formalin fixation, with the nanostructure survey we identified and monitored alterations on the hierarchical arrangement of triglycerides and collagen fibrils three-dimensionally in breast tumor specimens without requiring sample staining.  A high density of aligned collagen was observed precisely on the invasion front of the breast carcinoma, showing the direction of cancer spread, whereas substantial content of triglycerides was identified, where the healthy tissue was located.  Finally, the approach developed here provides a path to high-resolution nanostructural probing with a large field-of-view, which was demonstrated through the visualization of characteristic nanostructural arrangement and quantification of content and degree of organization of collagen fibrils in normal, benign and malignant human breast tissue.\n",

      "Characterizing biomolecular interactions is crucial to the understanding of biological processes.  Existing characterization methods have low spatial resolution, poor specificity, and some lack the capability for deep tissue imaging.  We describe a novel technique that relies on small-angle X-ray scattering signatures from high-contrast molecular probes that correlate with the presence of biomolecular interactions.  We describe a proof-of-concept study that uses a model system consisting of mixtures of monomer solutions of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as the non-interacting species and solutions of GNP dimers linked with an organic molecule (dimethyl suberimidate) as the interacting species.  We report estimates of the interaction fraction obtained with the proposed small-angle X-ray scattering characterization method exhibiting strong correlation with the known relative concentration of interacting and non-interacting species.\n",

      "DNA origami objects allow for accurate positioning of guest mols. in three dimensions.  Validation and understanding of design strategies for particle attachment as well as anal. of specific particle arrangements are desirable.  Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is suited to probe distances of nano-objects with subnanometer resoln. at physiol. relevant conditions including pH and salt and at varying temps.  Here, we show that the pair d. distribution function (PDDF) obtained from an indirect Fourier transform of SAXS intensities in a model-free way allows to investigate prototypical DNA origami-mediated gold nanoparticle (AuNP) assemblies.  We analyze the structure of three AuNP-dimers on a DNA origami block, an AuNP trimer constituted by those dimers, and a helical arrangement of nine AuNPs on a DNA origami cylinder.  For the dimers, we compare the model-free PDDF and explicit modeling of the SAXS intensity data by superposition of scattering intensities of the scattering objects.  The PDDF of the trimer is verified to be a superposition of its dimeric contributions, i.e., here AuNP-DNA origami assemblies were used as test boards underlining the validity of the PDDF anal. beyond pairs of AuNPs.  We obtain information about AuNP distances with an uncertainty margin of 1.2 nm.  This readout accuracy in turn can be used for high precision placement of AuNP by careful design of the AuNP attachment sites on the DNA-structure and by fine-tuning of the connector types.\n",

      "Colloidal nanoparticles may possess many functional properties, whose nature may be electronic, chem., biol., mech., etc.  It is often advantageous to incorporate them into a matrix material, e.g., a polymer soln. or melt, or an elastomer, in order to obtain a 'nanomaterial' with addnl. properties brought in by the filler particles.  One of the basic but nonetheless crucial properties is the mech. strength of such polymer nanocomposites, whose rheol. (or mech.) properties are usually better than those of the pure matrix.  The precise origin of this mech. reinforcement effect, however, remains unclear.  In this context, some recent studies of the structure and mech. properties of a special type of nanocomposites are reviewed here.  In silica-latex systems, a latex film with silica inclusions is formed from a colloidal soln. of both components.  During drying of the soln., the formation of silica domains can be controlled via the physico-chem. properties of the soln.  Well-defined silica aggregates embedded in a polymer matrix can be generated, and the mech. properties of the resulting nanocomposite have been shown to be directly correlated to the av. structure.  We believe that the fine-tuning of the structure of the filler phase opens new perspectives for systematic studies of the reinforcement effect, e.g., by modifying filler-polymer interfacial properties at fixed structure, or by generating original structures.\n",

      "The heat-induced desorption and adsorption of the proteins lysozyme, RNase A, bovine serum albumin, and fibronectin at protein layers was investigated in two different environments: pure buffer and protein soln.  Using two different environments allows us to distinguish between thermodn. and kinetic mechanisms in the adsorption process.  We obsd. a desorption in buffer and an adsorption in protein soln., depending upon protein properties, such as size, stability, and charge.  We conclude that the desorption in buffer is mainly influenced by the mobility of the proteins at the interface, while the adsorption in protein soln. is driven by conformational changes and, thereby, a gain in entropy.  These results are relevant for controlling biofilm formation at solid-liq. interfaces.\n",

      "The islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or amylin is a pancreatic hormone and crucially involved in the pathogenesis of type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  Aggregation and amyloid formation of IAPP is considered as the primary culprit for pancreatic β-cell loss in T2DM patients.  In this study, first X-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements on IAPP at lipid interfaces have been carried out, providing a mol. level characterization of the first steps of the lipid-induced fibrillation process of IAPP, which is initiated by lipid-induced nucleation, oligomerization, followed by detachment of larger IAPP aggregate structures from the lipid membrane, and terminated by the formation of mature fibrils in the bulk soln.  The adsorption process of IAPP at lipid interfaces in the absence and presence of neg. charged lipid has also been studied by complementary ATR-FTIR spectroscopic measurements.  The morphol. properties were followed by at. force microscopy (AFM).  Moreover, we show that the polyphenolic red wine compd. resveratrol is able to inhibit IAPP aggregation also in the presence of aggregation-fostering neg. charged lipid interfaces, revealing its potential as a drug candidate for T2DM.\n",

      "Drug design and targeted delivery in cells serve as a flourishing area not only for scientific inquiry, owing to numerous clin. applications, but also for understanding cell interaction with exogenous materials.  The membrane localization of heme and its analog hemin, one of the most biol. relevant planar org. mol., is very important to understand the mol. mechanism of intercalation and adsorption of this cytotoxic mol. after its dissocn. from proteins such as Hb.  Herein, the authors study the differential behavior of hemin on the soft membrane surfaces of phospholipids by synchrotron-based x-ray scattering techniques, Langmuir monolayer measurements, and mol. dynamics simulation.  A continuous hemin uptake from the subphase and intercalation into and/or adsorption on to the membrane surface have been witnessed in a strong membrane surface packing-specific manner.  Competitive interactions between hemin-membrane and hemin-hemin are proposed to be responsible for the crit. hemin concn.  Up to the limit, a continuous hemin uptake is possible and beyond that the hemin-hemin interaction dominates, effectively reducing the hemin intercalation into the membrane.  This structural model of the hemin-uptake process can be generalized to understand the localization and transport across membranes and also for the development and design of new drugs.\n",

      "The interaction of phospholipids with the peripheral membrane proteins like spectrin is important not only to understand the various physiol. functions of cells, but also to gain insight into the mechanism involved in the self-assembly of polymer-like long chain mols. at the soft surfaces and interfaces.  The lipid head-group specificity of adsorption of spectrin to supported phopsholipid bilayer model membranes has been investigated using the X-ray reflectivity (XRR) technique.  Model lipid bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) head groups have been prepd. on a soft polymer cushion and the XRR measurements have been carried out from the bilayers immersed in a water bath using high-energy synchrotron X-rays.  Our results suggest that in PC-based membranes the spectrin chains form a uniform layer on top of the bilayer with their chains lying on the membrane surface, while in PE-based membranes with relatively smaller head groups, the spectrin chains are attached only through a few possible binding sites with the rest of the part projected out of the membrane surface.  In addn., the reflectivity profiles reveal the penetration of spectrin polypeptide chains through the PE bilayer in its fluid phase.  Pressure-area isotherm measurements on Langmuir monolayers also support similar observations on the adsorption of spectrin mols. to the membranes composed of PC and PE.  The obsd. results were explained using a qual. model based on the ion-mediated protein interaction in the PC-based membrane.\n",

      "A review.  The interplay of ordering, confinement and growth in ultrathin films gives rise to various interesting phenomena not obsd. in bulk materials.  The nature of ordering and interfacial morphol. present in these films, in turn, depends on their growth mechanism.  Well-ordered metal-org. films, deposited using an enigmatic Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique, are not only ideal systems for understanding the interplay between growth and structure of ultrathin films but also for studying chem. reactions and phase transitions in confined geometries.  Studies on these LB films also enhance our understanding of the fundamental interactions of amphiphilic mols. important for biol. systems.  Advent of grazing incidence X-ray scattering techniques has enabled us to probe the interfacial structure of these multilayer films at very high resoln. and as a result has improved our knowledge about the mechanism of growth processes and about phys./chem. properties of ultrathin films.  In this review we will focus our attention on recent results obtained using these X-ray scattering techniques to understand the mechanism of growth leading to formation of remarkably well-ordered LB films after giving a brief outline of these scattering techniques.  In addn., we also review recent results on growth and structure of nanoparticles formed by suitable chem. processes within the ordered matrix of LB films.  Finally, we will discuss the work done on melting of LB films and its implications in our understanding of melting process in lower dimensions.  In all these studies, esp. those on as-deposited LB films results of at. force microscopy measurements have provided important complementary morphol. information.\n",

      "The air-water interface is an ideal platform to produce two-dimensional (2D) structures involving anything from simple org. mols. to supramol. moieties by exploiting hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions.  Here, we show, using grazing incidence X-ray scattering, the formation of a 2D ordered structure of a charge-transfer (C-T) complex, namely, dodecyl Me viologen (DMV) as acceptor and coronene tetracarboxylate potassium salt (CS) as donor, at the air-water interface.  We have obsd. a phase transition in the 2D ordered structure as the area per mol. is decreased with increasing surface pressure in a Langmuir trough.  The high-pressure ordering of the hydrocarbon chains assocd. with DMV destroys long-range C-T conjugation of DMV and CS at the air-water interface.  Our results also explain the formation of DMV-CS cylindrical reverse micelles and eventually long nanowires that get formed in the self-assembly process in the bulk medium to preserve both the C-T conjugation and the org. tail-tail organization.\n",

      "A review.  Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have been developed for imaging, drug delivery, diagnosis, and clin. therapeutic purposes because of their outstanding physicochem. characteristics.  However, the function and ultimate efficiency of nanomedicines remain unsatisfactory for clin. application, mainly because of our insufficient understanding of nanomaterial/nanomedicine-biol. (nano-bio) interactions.  The nonequilibrated, complex, and heterogeneous nature of the biol. milieu inevitably influences the dynamic bioidentity of nanoformulations at each site (i.e., the interfaces at different biol. fluids (biofluids), environments, or biol. structures) of nano-bio interactions.  The continuous interplay between a nanomedicine and the biol. mols. and structures in the biol. environments can, for example, affect cellular uptake or completely alter the designed function of the nanomedicine.  Accordingly, the weak and strong driving forces at the nano-bio interface may elicit structural reconformation, decrease bioactivity, and induce dysfunction of the nanomaterial and/or redox reactions with biol. mols., all of which may elicit unintended and unexpected biol. outcomes.  In contrast, these driving forces also can be manipulated to mitigate the toxicity of ENMs or improve the targeting abilities of ENMs.  Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of nano-bio interactions is paramount for the intelligent design of safe and effective nanomedicines.In this Account, we summarize our recent progress in probing the nano-bio interaction of nanomedicines, focusing on the driving force and redox reaction at the nano-bio interface, which have been recognized as the main factors that regulate the functions and toxicities of nanomedicines.  First, we provide insight into the driving force that shapes the boundary of different nano-bio interfaces (including proteins, cell membranes, and biofluids), for instance, hydrophobic, electrostatic, hydrogen bond, mol. recognition, metal-coordinate, and stereoselective interactions that influence the different nano-bio interactions at each contact site in the biol. environment.  The physicochem. properties of both the nanoparticle and the biomol. are varied, causing structure recombination, dysfunction, and bioactivity loss of proteins; correspondingly, the surface properties, biol. functions, intracellular uptake pathways, and fate of ENMs are also influenced.  Second, with the help of these driving forces, four kinds of redox interactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant, sorbate, and the prosthetic group of oxidoreductases are utilized to regulate the intracellular redox equil. and construct synergetic nanomedicines for combating bacteria and cancers.  Three kinds of electron-transfer mechanisms are involved in designing nanomedicines, including direct electron injection, sorbate-mediated, and irradn.-induced processes.  Finally, we discuss the factors that influence the nano-bio interactions and propose corresponding strategies to manipulate the nano-bio interactions for advancing nanomedicine design.  We expect our efforts in understanding the nano-bio interaction and the future development of this field will bring nanomedicine to human use more quickly.\n",

      "A review.  Rapid growth in nanotechnol. is increasing the likelihood of engineered nanomaterials coming into contact with humans and the environment.  Nanoparticles interacting with proteins, membranes, cells, DNA and organelles establish a series of nanoparticle/biol. interfaces that depend on colloidal forces as well as dynamic biophysicochem. interactions.  These interactions lead to the formation of protein coronas, particle wrapping, intracellular uptake and biocatalytic processes that could have biocompatible or bioadverse outcomes.  For their part, the biomols. may induce phase transformations, free energy releases, restructuring and dissoln. at the nanomaterial surface.  Probing these various interfaces allows the development of predictive relationships between structure and activity that are detd. by nanomaterial properties such as size, shape, surface chem., roughness and surface coatings.  This knowledge is important from the perspective of safe use of nanomaterials.\n",

      "A review.  Electrochem. reactions are involved in many natural phenomena, and responsible for various applications, including energy conversion and storage, material processing and protection, and chem. detection and anal.  An electrochem. reaction is accompanied by electron transfer between a chem. species and an electrode.  For this reason, it was studied by measuring current, charge or related elec. quantities.  This approach led to the development of various electrochem. methods, which have played an essential role in the understanding and applications of electrochem.  While powerful, most of the traditional methods lack spatial and temporal resolns. desired for studying heterogeneous electrochem. reactions on electrode surfaces and in nanoscale materials.  To overcome the limitations, scanning probe microscopes were invented to map local electrochem. reactions with nanometer resoln.  Examples include the Scanning Electrochem. Microscope and Scanning Electrochem. Cell Microscopes, which directly image local electrochem. reaction current using a scanning electrode or pipet.  The use of a scanning probe in these microscopes provides high spatial resoln., but at the expense of temporal resoln. and throughput.  This Account discusses an alternative approach to study electrochem. reactions.  Instead of measuring electron transfer elec., it detects the accompanying changes in the reactant and product concns. on the electrode surface optically via surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  SPR is highly surface sensitive, and it provides quant. information on the surface concns. of reactants and products vs. time and electrode potential, from which local reaction kinetics can be analyzed and quantified.  The plasmonic approach allows imaging of local electrochem. reactions with high temporal resoln. and sensitivity, making it attractive for studying electrochem. reactions in biol. systems and nanoscale materials with high throughput.  The plasmonic approach has two imaging modes: electrochem. current imaging and interfacial impedance imaging.  The former images local electrochem. current assocd. with electrochem. reactions (faradaic current), and the latter maps local interfacial impedance, including non-faradaic contributions (e.g., double layer charging).  The plasmonic imaging technique can perform voltammetry (cyclic or square wave) in an analogous manner to the traditional electrochem. methods.  It can also be integrated with bright field, dark field and fluorescence imaging capabilities in one optical setup to provide addnl. capabilities.  To date the plasmonic imaging technique found various applications, including mapping of heterogeneous surface reactions, anal. of trace substances, detection of catalytic reactions, and measurement of graphene quantum capacitance.  The plasmonic and other emerging optical imaging techniques (e.g., dark field and fluorescence microscopy), together with the scanning probe-based electrochem. imaging and single nanoparticle anal. techniques, provide new capabilities for one to study single nanoparticle electrochem. with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolns.  In this Account, the authors focus on imaging of electrochem. reactions at single nanoparticles.\n",

      "Semiconductor photocatalysis holds promising keys to address various energy and environmental challenges.  Most studies to date are based on ensemble anal., which may mask crit. photocatalytic kinetics in single nanocatalysts.  Here we report a study of imaging photocatalytic hydrogen prodn. of single CdS nanoparticles with a plasmonic microscopy in an in operando manner.  Surprisingly, we find that the photocatalytic reaction switches on and off stochastically despite the fact that the illumination is kept const.  The on and off states follow truncated and full-scale(coating process) power-law distributions in broad time scales spanning 3-4 orders of magnitude, resp., which can be described with a statistical simulation, physicochem. involving stochastic reactions rates at multiple active sites.  This phenomenon is analogous to fluorescence photoblinking, but the underlying mechanism is different.  As individual nanocatalyst represents the elementary photocatalytic platform, the discovery of the intermittent nature of the photocatalysis provides insights into the fundamental photochem. and photophysics of semiconductor nanomaterials, which is anticipated to substantially benefit broad application fields such as clean energy, pollution treatment, and chem. synthesis.\n",

      "Measuring electrochem. activities of nanomaterials is crit. for creating novel catalysts, for developing ultrasensitive sensors, and for understanding fundamental nanoelectrochem.  However, traditional electrochem. methods measure a large no. of nanoparticles, which wash out the properties of individual nanoparticles.  We report here a study of transient electrochem. oxidn. of single Ag nanoparticles during collision with an electrode and voltammetry of single nanoparticles immobilized on the electrode using a plasmonic-based electrochem. current microscopy.  This technique images both electrochem. reaction and size of the same individual nanoparticle, enabling quant. examn. of size-dependent electrochem. activities at single nanoparticle level.  The imaging capability further allows detection of the reaction kinetics of each individual nanoparticle and anal. of the av. behaviors of multiple nanoparticles.  The av. kinetics and size dependence can be accurately described by the Tafel equation, but there is a large variability between different nanoparticles, which underscores the importance of single nanoparticle anal.\n",

      "This article describes a multimodified core-shell gold@silver nanoprobe for real-time monitoring the entire autophagy process at single-cell level.  Autophagy is vital for understanding the mechanisms of human pathologies, developing novel drugs, and exploring approaches for autophagy controlling.  A major challenge for autophagy study lies in real-time monitoring.  One soln. might come from real-time detection of in situ superoxide radicals (O2•-), because it is the main regulator of autophagy.  The authors' proposed nanoprobes were etched by O2•- and gave a notable wavelength change in the plasmon resonance scattering spectra.  Both the exptl. and simulated results suggested the wavelength change rate correlated well with O2•- level.  This response enabled its application in real-time in situ quantification of O2•- during autophagy course.  More importantly, with the introduction of relay probe operation, two types of O2•--regulating autophagy processes were successfully traced from the beginning to the end, and the possible mechanism is also proposed.\n",

      "A review.  This Perspective provides a contemporary understanding of the shape evolution of colloidal metal nanocrystals under thermodynamically and kinetically controlled conditions.  It was extremely challenging to study this subject in the setting of 1-pot synthesis because both the type and no. of seeds involved would be changed whenever the exptl. conditions are altered, making it essentially impossible to draw conclusions when comparing the outcomes of 2 syntheses conducted under different conditions.  Because of the uncertainty about seeds, most of the mechanistic insights reported in literature for 1-pot syntheses of metal nanocrystals with different shapes are either incomplete or ambiguous, and some of them might be misleading or even wrong.  Recently, using well-defined seeds for such syntheses, it became possible to sep. growth from nucleation and therefore study the explicit role(s) played by a specific thermodn. or kinetic parameter in directing the evolution of colloidal metal nanocrystals into a specific shape.  Starting from single-crystal seeds enclosed by a mix of {100}, {111}, and {110} facets, for example, one can obtain colloidal nanocrystals with diversified shapes by adjusting various thermodn. or kinetic parameters.  The mechanistic insights learned from these studies can also be extended to account for the products of conventional 1-pot syntheses that involve self-nucleation only.  The knowledge can be further applied to many other types of seeds with twin defects or stacking faults, making it an exciting time to design and synthesize colloidal metal nanocrystals with the shapes sought for a variety of fundamental studies and technol. important applications.\n",

      "Supramol. chem. uses coordination bonds to assemble mol. building blocks into a variety of sophisticated constructs.  However, traditional coordination assemblies are based on org. compds. that have limited ability to transport charge.  Herein, the authors describe coordination assembly of anisotropic FeS2 pyrite nanoparticles (NPs) that can facilitate charge transport.  Zn2+ ions form supramol. complexes with carboxylate end-groups on NP surface, leading to multiparticle sheets with liq.-crystal-like organization.  Cond. and Hall carrier mobility of the p-type layered semiconductor films with Zn2+ coordination bridging exceed those known for coordination compds., some by several orders of magnitude.  The nanoscale porosity of the assembled sheets combined with fast hole transport leads to high electrocatalytic activity of the NP films.  The coordination assembly of NPs embraces the versatility of several types of building blocks and opens a new design space for self-organized materials combining nanoscale and supramol. structural motifs.\n",

      "The chem. and catalytic activity of nanoparticles has strongly contributed to the current tremendous interest in engineered nanomaterials and often serves as a guiding principle for the design of functional materials.  Since it has most recently become evident that such active materials can enter into cells or organisms, the present study investigates the level of intracellular oxidns. after exposure to iron-, cobalt-, manganese-, and titania-contg. silica nanoparticles and the corresponding pure oxides in vitro.  The resulting oxidative stress was quant. measured as the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  The use of thoroughly characterized nanoparticles of the same morphol., comparable size, shape, and degree of agglomeration allowed sepn. of phys. (rate of particle uptake, agglomeration, sedimentation) and chem. effects (oxidns.).  Three sets of control expts. elucidated the role of nanoparticles as carriers for heavy metal uptake and excluded a potential interference of the biol. assay with the nanomaterial.  The present results indicate that the particles could efficiently enter the cells by a Trojan-horse type mechanism which provoked an up to eight times higher oxidative stress in the case of cobalt or manganese if compared to ref. cultures exposed to aq. solns. of the same metals.  A systematic investigation on iron-contg. nanoparticles as used in industrial fine chem. synthesis demonstrated that the presence of catalytic activity could strongly alter the damaging action of a nanomaterial.  This indicates that a proactive development of nanomaterials and their risk assessment should consider chem. and catalytic properties of nanomaterials beyond a mere focus on phys. properties such as size, shape, and degree of agglomeration.\n",

      "The structural dynamics of charge-transfer states of N-ligated Cu complexes was extensively studied in recent years following the development of pump-probe x-ray techniques.  The authors extend this approach towards Cu complexes with S coordination and study the influence of charge transfer states on the structure of a dicopper(I) complex with coordination by bridging disulfide ligands and addnl. tetramethylguanidine units [CuI2(NSSN)2]2+.  To directly observe and refine the photoinduced structural changes in the solvated complex the authors applied picosecond pump-probe x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS).  Addnl., the ultrafast evolution of the electronic excited states was monitored by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in the UV-visible probe range.  DFT calcns. were used to predict mol. geometries and electronic structures of the ground and metal-to-ligand charge transfer states with singlet and triplet spin multiplicities, i.e. S0, 1MLCT and 3MLCT, resp.  Combining these techniques the authors elucidate the electronic and structural dynamics of the solvated complex upon photoexcitation to the MLCT states.  In particular, femtosecond optical transient spectroscopy reveals three distinct timescales of 650 fs, 10 ps and >100 ps, which were assigned as internal conversion to the ground state (Sn → S0), intersystem crossing 1MLCT → 3MLCT, and subsequent relaxation of the triplet to the ground state, resp.  Exptl. data collected using both x-ray techniques are in agreement with the DFT-predicted structure for the triplet state, where coordination bond lengths change and one of the S-S bridges is cleaved, causing the movement of two halves of the mol. relative to each other.  Extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy resolves changes in Cu-ligand bond lengths with precision ∼0.01 Å, whereas WAXS is sensitive to changes in the global shape related to relative movement of parts of the mol.  The results presented herein widen the knowledge on the electronic and structural dynamics of photoexcited Cu-S complexes and demonstrate the potential of combining the pump-probe x-ray absorption and scattering for studies on photoinduced structural dynamics in Cu-based coordination complexes.\n",

      "Investigation of the genotoxic potential of nanomaterials is essential to evaluate if they pose a cancer risk for exposed workers and consumers.  The Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-K1 is recommended by the OECD for use in the micronucleus assay and is commonly used for genotoxicity testing.  However, studies investigating if this cell line is suitable for the genotoxic evaluation of nanomaterials, including induction of DNA adduct and micronuclei formation, are rare and for silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) missing.  Therefore, the authors here systematically investigated DNA and chromosomal damage induced by BSA coated Ag NPs (15.9 nm) in CHO-K1 cells in relation to cellular uptake and intracellular localization, their effects on mitochondrial activity and prodn. of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell cycle, apoptosis and necrosis.  Ag NPs are taken up by CHO-K1 cells and are presumably translocated into endosomes/lysosomes.  The authors' cytotoxicity studies demonstrated a concn.-dependent decrease of mitochondrial activity and increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CHO-K1 cells following exposure to Ag NPs and Ag+ (0-20 μg/mL) for 24 h.  Annexin V/propidium iodide assay showed that Ag NPs and Ag+ induced apoptosis and necrosis, which is in agreement with an increased fraction of cells in subG1 phase of the cell cycle.  Genotoxicity studies showed that Ag NPs but also silver ions (Ag+) induced bulky-DNA adducts, 8-oxodG and micronuclei formation in a concn.-dependent manner, however, there were quant. and qual. differences between the particulate and ionic form of silver.  Taken together, the authors' multi-platform genotoxicity and cytotoxicity anal. demonstrates that CHO-K1 cells are suitable for the investigation of genotoxicity of nanoparticles like Ag NPs.\n",

      "Nanomaterials (NM) exhibit novel physicochem. properties that det. their interaction with biol. substrates and processes.  Three metal oxide nanoparticles that are currently being produced in high tonnage, TiO2, ZnO, and CeO2, were synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis process and compared in a mechanistic study to elucidate the physicochem. characteristics that det. cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and toxic effects based on a test paradigm that was originally developed for oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 and BEAS-2B cell lines.  ZnO induced toxicity in both cells, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidant injury, excitation of inflammation, and cell death.  Using ICP-MS and fluorescent-labeled ZnO, it is found that ZnO dissoln. could happen in culture medium and endosomes.  Nondissolved ZnO nanoparticles enter caveolae in BEAS-2B but enter lysosomes in RAW 264.7 cells in which smaller particle remnants dissolve.  In contrast, fluorescent-labeled CeO2 nanoparticles were taken up intact into caveolin-1 and LAMP-1 pos. endosomal compartments, resp., in BEAS-2B and RAW 264.7 cells, without inflammation or cytotoxicity.  Instead, CeO2 suppressed ROS prodn. and induced cellular resistance to an exogenous source of oxidative stress.  Fluorescent-labeled TiO2 was processed by the same uptake pathways as CeO2 but did not elicit any adverse or protective effects.  These results demonstrate that metal oxide nanoparticles induce a range of biol. responses that vary from cytotoxic to cytoprotective and can only be properly understood by using a tiered test strategy such as the authors developed for oxidative stress and adapted to study other aspects of nanoparticle toxicity.\n",

      "The liver and the mononuclear phagocyte system are a frequent target for engineered nanomaterials, either as a result of particle uptake and spread from primary exposure sites or systemic administration of therapeutic and imaging nanoparticles.  In this study, the authors performed a comparative anal. of the toxicol. impact of 29 metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), some commonly used in consumer products, in transformed or primary Kupffer cells (KCs) and hepatocytes.  The authors not only obsd. differences between KCs and hepatocytes, but also differences in the toxicol. profiles of transition-metal oxides (TMOs, e.g., Co3O4) vs. rare-earth oxide (REO) NPs (e.g., Gd2O3).  While pro-oxidative TMOs induced the activation of caspases 3 and 7, resulting in apoptotic cell death in both cell types, REOs induced lysosomal damage, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase 1 activation, and pyroptosis in KCs.  Pyroptosis was accompanied by cell swelling, membrane blebbing, IL-1β release, and increased membrane permeability, which could be reversed by knockdown of the pore forming protein, gasdermin D.  Though similar features were not seen in hepatocytes, the investigation of the cytotoxic effects of REO NPs could also be seen to affect macrophage cell lines such as J774A.1 and RAW 264.7 cells as well as bone marrow-derived macrophages.  These phagocytic cell types also demonstrated features of pyroptosis and increased IL-1β prodn.  Collectively, these findings demonstrate important mechanistic considerations that can be used for safety evaluation of metal oxides, including com. products that are developed from these materials.\n",

      "Abstr.: The safe implementation of nanotechnol. requires nanomaterial hazard assessment in accordance with the material physicochem. properties that trigger the injury response at the nano/bio interface.  Since CuO nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used industrially and their dissoln. properties play a major role in hazard potential, the authors hypothesized that tighter bonding of Cu to Fe by particle doping could constitute a safer-by-design approach through decreased dissoln.  Accordingly, the authors designed a combinatorial library in which CuO was doped with 1-10% Fe in a flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) reactor.  The morphol. and structural properties were detd. by x-ray diffraction, BET, Raman spectroscopy, HRTEM, EFTEM and EELS, which demonstrated a significant redn. in the apical Cu-O bond length while simultaneously increasing the planar bond length (Jahn-Teller distortion).  Hazard screening was performed in tissue culture cell lines and zebrafish embryos to discern the change in the hazardous effects of doped vs. non-doped particles.  This demonstrated that with increased levels of doping, there was a progressive decrease in cytotoxicity in BEAS-2B and THP-1 cells, as well as an incremental decrease in the rate of hatching interference in zebrafish embryos.  The dissoln. profiles were detd. and the surface reactions taking place in Holtfreter's soln. were validated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements to demonstrate the Cu+/Cu2+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ redox species playing a major role in the dissoln. process of pure and Fe doped CuO.  Altogether, a safe-by-design strategy was implemented for the toxic CuO particles via Fe doping and has been demonstrated for their safe use in the environment.  Keywords: flame spray pyrolysis, CuO nanoparticles, Fe doping, Jahn-Teller distortion, cyclic voltammetry, safe-by-design.\n",

      "A key challenge for the use of inorg. nanomedicines in clin. applications is their long-term accumulation in internal organs, which raises the common concern of the risk of adverse effects and inflammatory responses.  It is thus necessary to rationally design inorg. nanomaterials with proper accumulation and clearance mechanism in vivo.  Herein, we prepd. ultrasmall Cu3BiS3 nanodots (NDs) as a single-phased ternary bimetal sulfide for photothermal cancer therapy guided by multispectral optoacoustic tomog. (MSOT) and X-ray computed tomog. (CT) due to bismuth's excellent X-ray attenuation coeff.  We then monitored and investigated their absorption, distribution, metab., and excretion.  We also used CT imaging to demonstrate that Cu3BiS3 NDs can be quickly removed through renal clearance, which may be related to their small size, rapid chem. transformation, and degrdn. in an acidic lysosomal environment as characterized by synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy.  These results reveal that Cu3BiS3 NDs act as a simple but powerful \"theranostic\" nanoplatform for MSOT/CT imaging-guided tumor ablation with excellent metab. and rapid clearance that will improve safety for clin. applications in the future.\n",

      "A review.  Absorption, distribution, metab. and excretion (ADME) of nanomaterials (NMs) or nanomedicines (NMs), are fundamental biol. processes that dominate their nanomedical functions or nanotoxicities.  Mostly, NMs exist in biol. systems as a form of nanoparticles (NPs).  However, to det. the compn., spatial distribution, and states of existence of NMs/NPs in vivo, upon entry into the body, as well as to monitor the dynamic changes of these information over time remain a challenge for the current anal. methodol. due to their limited efficiently in characterizing interactions between these complex(nano)-complex(bio) systems.  NMs/NPs are more complicated compared with the classic chem. mols., ions or elements, while biol. systems pose even greater difficulties being a complicated network of chem./biol. compn., multihierarchical structures, the highly dynamic nature, nonequil. states and nonlinear chem. processes, etc.  Thus, although some existing methods/protocols have promoted the understanding of how NMs/NPs interact with biol. systems, almost none of these are fully adequate for quant. analyses.  Examples of conventional methods used for nano-bio anal. include, methods for element quantification which are partially applicable for NMs/NPs, such as at. spectrometry, isotopic labeling and nuclear anal. methods, which are useful for elemental identification in detn. of accumulation and distributions, and imaging-based methods have facilitated the quantification of NMs/NPs during their in vivo transportation, translocation and transformation processes.  In the early stage of nanosafety research, qual. study of NMs/NPs' behaviors in vivo was widely employed, which, however, have resulted in much inconsistency or even contradiction among reports on the same NMs/NPs' safety profile from different labs.  Recently, it was recognized that quant. anal. method are necessary for the accurate characterization of the complicated behaviors of NMs/NPs in vivo.  For example, in order to understand the in vivo biol. effects of a given nanomaterial, one needs to first monitor the dynamic changes of its components in blood circulation as well as in different organs or tissues to det. key bio-parameters such as the half-lives, and the compn. of metabolites of the nanomaterial interested, etc.  Such understanding requires quant. methodol. to construct a reliably whole spectrum of NMs/NPs' fate in vivo, which would be essential not only in nanosafety assessment of NMs/NPs, but also in the development of their biomedical applications in fields such as cancer nanotechnol.\n",

      "Mitochondrial redox homeostasis, the balance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidants such as glutathione, plays crit. roles in many biol. processes, including biosynthesis and apoptosis, and thus is a potential target for cancer treatment.  Here, we report a mitochondrial oxidative stress amplifier, MitoCAT-g, which consists of carbon-dot-supported atomically dispersed gold (CAT-g) with further surface modifications of triphenylphosphine and cinnamaldehyde.  We find that the MitoCAT-g particles specifically target mitochondria and deplete mitochondrial glutathione with at. economy, thus amplifying the reactive oxygen species damage caused by cinnamaldehyde and finally leading to apoptosis in cancer cells.  We show that imaging-guided interventional injection of these particles potently inhibits tumor growth in s.c. and orthotopic patient-derived xenograft hepatocellular carcinoma models without adverse effects.  Our study demonstrates that MitoCAT-g amplifies the oxidative stress in mitochondria and suppresses tumor growth in vivo, representing a promising agent for anticancer applications.\n",

      "A review.  In this perspective, the HERFD-XANES (high energy resoln. fluorescence detected x-ray absorption near edge structure) and Kβ2,5- or V2C-XES (valence-to-core X-ray emission spectroscopy) methods are discussed as new and powerful tools for chem. research with hard X-rays.  This includes a brief survey of the underlying phys. processes and the introduction of exptl. issues.  The potential of both methods to overcome limitations of conventional XAS (x-ray absorption spectroscopy) and to push the limits for obtaining new information about the electronic and geometric structures of metal centers, in the solid state structure or heterogeneous catalysts, but also in metal complexes and homogeneous catalysts, is discussed by presenting a survey of representative refs. and recent own studies, rounded off by a conclusion and outlook.\n",

      "A review.  This Progress Report discusses the chem. sensitivity of Kβ valence to core X-ray emission spectroscopy (vtc-XES) and its applications for investigating 3d-transition-metal based materials.  Vtc-XES can be used for ligand identification and for the characterization of the valence electronic levels.  The technique provides information that is similar to valence band photoemission spectroscopy but the sample environment can be chosen freely and thus allows measurements in presence of gases and liqs. and it can be applied for measurements under in situ/operando or extreme conditions.  The theor. basis of the technique is presented using a one-electron approach and the vtc-XES spectral features are interpreted using ground state d. functional theory calcns.  Some recent results obtained by vtc-XES in various scientific fields are discussed to demonstrate the potential and future applications of this technique.  Resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy is briefly introduced with some applications for the study of 3d and 5d-transition-metal based systems.\n",

Compared with La(OH)3 or previously known hexagonal La2O2CO3 structures, La in the monoclinic unit cell has a much lower no. of neighboring oxygen atoms, which is manifested in the white line broadening in XANES spectra.  Such a superior sensitivity to subtle changes is given by HERFD method, which is essential for in situ studying of the interaction with CO2.  La2O2CO3-based sensors in real operando conditions at 250°C in the presence of oxygen and water vapors.  The distribution of unoccupied La d-states and occupied O p- and La d-states changes during CO2 chemoresistive sensing of La2O2CO3.  The correlation between these spectroscopic findings with elec. resistance measurements leads to a more comprehensive understanding of the selective adsorption at La site and may enable the design of new materials for CO2 electrochem. applications.\n",

      "Nitrogenase is a complex enzyme that catalyzes the redn. of N2 to NH3.  Despite insight from structural and biochem. studies, its structure and mechanism await full characterization.  An Fe-Mo cofactor (FeMoco) is thought to be the site of N2 redn., but the identity of a central atom in this cofactor remains unknown.  Here, Fe Kβ x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) of intact nitrogenase MoFe protein, isolated FeMoco, and the FeMoco-deficient ΔnifB protein indicated that among the candidate atoms (O, N, and C), it was C that best fit the XES data.  The exptl. XES was supported by computational efforts, which showed that oxidn. and spin states did not affect the assignment of the central atom to C4-.  Identification of the central atom will drive further studies on its role in catalysis.\n",

      "X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a powerful probe of mol. structure, but it has previously been too slow to track the earliest dynamics after photoexcitation.  We investigated the ultrafast formation of the lowest quintet state of aq. iron(II) tris(bipyridine) upon excitation of the singlet metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (1MLCT) state by femtosecond optical pump/x-ray probe techniques based on x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES).  By recording the intensity of a characteristic XANES feature as a function of laser pump/x-ray probe time delay, we find that the quintet state is populated in about 150 fs.  The quintet state is further evidenced by its full XANES spectrum recorded at a 300-fs time delay.  These results resolve a long-standing issue about the population mechanism of quintet states in iron(II)-based complexes, which we identify as a simple 1MLCT→3MLCT→5T cascade from the initially excited state.  The time scale of the 3MLCT→5T relaxation corresponds to the period of the iron-nitrogen stretch vibration.\n",

      "In-situ carbon-thermal redn. of cobalt oxide nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes was studied by cobalt 2p3d resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS).  The in-situ 2p X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and RIXS measurements were performed at 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C, where four consistent excitations energies were used for RIXS acquisitions.  After 700 °C redn., the XAS spectrum shows a cobalt metal-like shape, while the RIXS spectra reveal the minority cobalt monoxide phase.  The holistic fit on both XAS and RIXS data reveals the resp. contributions from metal and monoxide.  We show that the relative precision to det. the monoxide content changes from ∼5.6% in XAS results to better than 0.8% in the RIXS anal., suggesting that RIXS is a useful tool to track the oxidn. state of nanoparticles under in-situ conditions.  We detd. a relative radiative ratio (P) factor of approx. 5, where this factor gives the ratio between the relative strengths of the radiative decay channels compared to the non-radiative channels in CoO and Co metal.\n",

      "Nanostructures of transition metal oxides, such as zinc oxide, have attracted considerable interest for solar-energy conversion and photocatalysis.  Both applications are sensitive to the transport and trapping of photoexcited charge carriers.  The probing of electron trapping has recently become possible using time-resolved element-sensitive methods, such as X-ray spectroscopy.  However, valence-band-trapped holes have so far escaped observation.  Herein we use X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with a dispersive X-ray emission spectrometer to probe the charge carrier relaxation and trapping processes in zinc oxide nanoparticles after above band-gap photoexcitation.  Our results, supported by simulations, demonstrate that within 80 ps, photoexcited holes are trapped at singly charged oxygen vacancies, which causes an outward displacement by ~15% of the four surrounding zinc atoms away from the doubly charged vacancy.  This identification of the hole traps provides insight for future developments of transition metal oxide-based nanodevices.\n",

      "Zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the most versatile semiconductor materials with multifarious potential applications.  Easily accessible alkylzinc alkoxides have been widely exploited as single-source precursors of ZnO-based nanomaterials but their multi-step decompn. pathways have not been understood in detail.  Herein, the formation mechanism of ZnO nanocrystals via solid-state thermal decompn. of a model pre-organised alkylzinc alkoxide precursor, i.e. [tBuZn(μ3-OtBu)]4, is elucidated using in situ valence-to-core X-ray emission (v2c-XES) and high energy resoln. off-resonant spectroscopy (HEROS) in conjunction with theor. calcns.  Combination of in situ spectroscopic measurements and theor. simulations indicates that the precursor structural evolution is initiated by the homolytic cleavage of the R-Zn bond, which leads to the formation of a transient radical ([Zn(μ3-OR)][RZn(μ3-OR)]3) species, which is responsible for the initial decompn. process.  The ensuing multistep transformations involve the formation of intermediate radical zinc oxo-alkoxide clusters with gapless electronic states.  Hitherto, the formation of clusters of this type has not been considered either as intermediate structures en route to a semiconductor ZnO phase or as potential species accounting for various defect states of ZnO NCs, particularly the singly charged oxygen vacancy, Vo+.\n",

      "Stochastic processes are highly relevant in research fields as different as neuroscience, economy, ecology, chemistry, and fundamental physics.  However, due to their intrinsic unpredictability, stochastic mechanisms are very challenging for any kind of investigations and practical applications.  Here we report the deliberate use of stochastic X-ray pulses in two-dimensional spectroscopy to the simultaneous mapping of unoccupied and occupied electronic states of atoms in a regime where the opacity and transparency properties of matter are subject to the incident intensity and photon energy.  A readily transferable matrix formalism is presented to extract the electronic states from a dataset measured with the monitored input from a stochastic excitation source.  The presented formalism enables investigations of the response of the electronic structure to irradiation with intense X-ray pulses while the time structure of the incident pulses is preserved.\n",

      "The increasing use of nanoparticles (NP) in com. products requires elaborated techniques to detect NP in the tissue of exposed organisms.  However, due to the low amt. of material, the detection and exact localization of NP within tissue sections is demanding.  In this respect, Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and Ion Beam Microscopy (IBM) are promising techniques, because they both offer sub-micron lateral resolns. along with high sensitivities.  Here, we compare the performance of the non-material-consumptive IBM and material-consumptive ToF-SIMS for the detection of ZrO2 NP (primary size 9-10 nm) in rat lung tissue.  Unfixed or methanol-fixed air-dried cryo-sections were subjected to IBM using proton beam scanning or to three-dimensional ToF-SIMS (3D ToF-SIMS) using either oxygen or argon gas cluster ion beams for complete sample sputtering.  Some sample sites were analyzed first by IBM and subsequently by 3D ToF-SIMS, to compare results from exactly the same site.  Both techniques revealed that ZrO2 NP particles occurred mostly agglomerated in phagocytic cells with only small quantities being assocd. to the lung epithelium, with Zr, S, and P colocalized within the same biol. structures.  However, while IBM provided quant. information on element distribution, 3D ToF-SIMS delivered a higher lateral resoln. and a lower limit of detection under these conditions.  We, therefore, conclude that 3D ToF-SIMS, although not yet a quant. technique, is a highly valuable tool for the detection of NP in biol. tissue.\n",

      "The investigation of the toxicol. profile and biomedical potential of nanoparticles (NPs) requires a deep understanding of their intracellular fate.  Various techniques are usually employed to characterize NPs upon cellular internalization, including high-resoln. optical and electron microscopies.  Here, the authors show a versatile method, named sputtering-enabled intracellular XPS, proving that it is able to provide valuable information about the behavior of metallic NPs in culture media as well as within cells, directly measuring their internalization, stability/degrdn., and oxidn. state, without any preparative steps.  The technique can also provide nanoscale vertical resoln. along with semiquant. information about the cellular internalization of the metallic species.  The proposed approach is easy-to-use and can become a std. technique in nanotoxicol./nanomedicine and in the rational design of metallic NPs.  Two model cases were investigated: silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) with the same size and coating.  The authors obsd. that, after 48 h incubation, intracellular AgNPs were almost completely dissolved, forming nanoclusters as well as AgO, AgS, and AgCl complexes.  On the other hand, PtNPs were resistant to the harsh endolysosomal environment, and only some surface oxidn. was detected after 48 h.\n",

      "The first X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy expts. using the fast single-photon-counting detector PILATUS (Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland) have been performed.  The short readout time of this detector permits access to intensity autocorrelation functions describing dynamics in the millisecond range that are difficult to access with charge-coupled device detectors with typical readout times of several seconds.  Showing no readout noise the PILATUS detector enables measurements of samples that either display fast dynamics or possess only low scattering power with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio.\n",

      "X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy was used to probe the diffusive dynamics of colloidal particles in a shear flow.  Combining x-ray techniques with microfluidics is an exptl. strategy that reduces the risk of x-ray-induced beam damage and also allows time-resolved studies of processes taking place in flow cells.  The exptl. results and theor. predictions presented here show that in the low shear limit for a 'transverse flow' scattering geometry (scattering wavevector q perpendicular to the direction of flow) the measured relaxation times are independent of the flow rate and detd. only by the diffusive motion of the particles.  This is not generally valid and, in particular, for a 'longitudinal flow' (q ‖ flow) scattering geometry the relaxation times are strongly affected by the flow-induced motion of the particles.  The Brownian diffusion of colloidal particles can be measured in a flowing sample and that, up to flux limitations, the exptl. conditions under which this is possible are easier to achieve at higher values of q.\n",

      "X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy was used to measure the diffusive dynamics of colloidal particles in a shear flow.  The results presented here show how the intensity autocorrelation functions measure both the diffusive dynamics of the particles and their flow-induced, convective motion.  However, in the limit of low flow/shear rates, it is possible to obtain the diffusive component of the dynamics, which makes the method suitable for the study of the dynamical properties of a large class of complex soft-matter and biol. fluids.  An important benefit of this exptl. strategy over more traditional X-ray methods is the minimization of X-ray-induced beam damage.  While the method can be applied also for photon correlation spectroscopy in the visible domain, the anal. shows that the exptl. conditions under which it is possible to measure the diffusive dynamics are easier to achieve at higher q values (with X-rays).\n",

We det. the thresholds above which the x-ray pulses disturb the at. arrangements.  Furthermore, high contrast speckle is obsd. in scattering patterns from the glasses integrated over many pulses, demonstrating that the source and optics are sufficiently stable for x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy studies of dynamics over a wide range of time scales.\n",

      "X-ray radiation damage provides a serious bottleneck for investigating microsecond to second dynamics on nanometer length scales employing x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy.  This limitation hinders the investigation of real time dynamics in most soft matter and biol. materials which can tolerate only x-ray doses of kGy and below.  Here, we show that this bottleneck can be overcome by low dose x-ray speckle visibility spectroscopy.  Employing x-ray doses of 22-438 kGy and analyzing the sparse speckle pattern of count rates as low as 6.7×10-3 per pixel, we follow the slow nanoscale dynamics of an ionic liq. (IL) at the glass transition.  At the prepeak of nanoscale order in the IL, we observe complex dynamics upon approaching the glass transition temp. TG with a freezing in of the alpha relaxation and a multitude of millisecond local relaxations existing well below TG.  We identify this fast relaxation as being responsible for the increasing development of nanoscale order obsd. in ILs at temps. below TG.\n",

      "We explore the origins of slow dynamics, aging and glassy rheol. in soft and living matter.  Non-diffusive slow dynamics and aging in materials characterised by crowding of the constituents can be explained in terms of structural rearrangement or remodelling events that occur within the jammed state.  In this context, we introduce the jamming phase diagram proposed by Liu and Nagel to understand the ergodic-nonergodic transition in these systems, and discuss recent theor. attempts to explain the unusual, faster-than-exponential dynamical structure factors obsd. in jammed soft materials.  We next focus on the anomalous rheol. (flow and deformation behavior) ubiquitous in soft matter characterised by metastability and structural disorder, and refer to the Soft Glassy Rheol. (SGR) model that quantifies the mech. response of these systems and predicts aging under suitable conditions.  As part of a survey of exptl. work related to these issues, we present x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) results of the aging of laponite clay suspensions following rejuvenation.  We conclude by exploring the scientific literature for recent theor. advances in the understanding of these models and for exptl. investigations aimed at testing their predictions.\n",

A faster relaxation process emergent from the localized motions of the nanoparticles reveals a dynamically-arrested network at the nanoscale as a key signature of the gelation process.  We find that the slower network dynamics is hyperdiffusive with a compressed exponential form, consistent with stress-driven relaxation processes.  Specifically, we use direction-dependent correlation functions to characterize the anisotropy in dynamics.  We show that the anisotropy is greater for the gel close to its gelation point than at lower temps., and the anisotropy decreases as the gel ages.  We quantify the anisotropic dynamical heterogeneities emergent in such a stress-driven dynamical system using higher order intensity correlations, and demonstrate that the aging phenomenon contributes significantly to the properties evaluated by the fluctuations in the intensity correlations.  Our results provide important insights into the structural origin of the emergent anisotropic and cooperative heterogeneous dynamics, and we discuss analogies with previous work on other soft disordered systems.\n",

      "This study explores the possibility of measuring the dynamics of proteins in solution using X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) at nearly diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs).  We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of XPCS experiments from a concentrated lysozyme solution at the length scale of the hydrodynamic radius of the protein molecule.  We take into account limitations given by the critical X-ray dose and find expressions for the SNR as a function of beam size, sample-to-detector distance and photon energy.  Specifically, we show that the combined increase in coherent flux and coherence lengths at the DLSR PETRA IV yields an increase in SNR of more than one order of magnitude.  The resulting SNR values indicate that XPCS experiments of biological macromolecules on nanometre length scales will become feasible with the advent of a new generation of synchrotron sources.  Our findings provide valuable input for the design and construction of future XPCS beamlines at DLSRs.\n",

      "The application of X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) at free-electron laser (FEL) facilities enables, for the first time, the study of dynamics on a (sub-)nanometer scale in an unreached time range between femtoseconds and seconds.  For soft-matter materials, radiation damage is a major limitation when going beyond single-shot applications.  Here, an XPCS study is presented at a hard X-ray FEL on radiation-sensitive polymeric poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanoparticles.  The dynamics of aq. suspensions of densely packed silica-PNIPAM core-shell particles and a PNIPAM nanogel below the radiation-damage threshold are detd.  The XPCS data indicate non-diffusive behavior, suggesting ballistic and stress-dominated heterogeneous particle motions.  These results demonstrate the feasibility of XPCS expts. on radiation-sensitive soft-matter materials at FEL sources and pave the way for future applications at MHz repetition rates as well as ultrafast modes using split-pulse devices.\n",

      "A review.  Fluidic shear stress generated by fluid flow in human body contributes to the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and cells and may affect cellular distribution and delivery of NPs.  Furthermore, different NPs properties may differently influence the cellular delivery and targeting of NPs under the in vivo dynamic environments.  Thus, we reviewed and discussed how fluidic shear stress affects to drug delivery and cellular distribution of diverse NPs under the biomimetic microfluidic shear stress.  Among different physicochem. properties of NPs, size, shape, material type and surface functionality, and surface charge of NPs are crit. factors to cellular uptake in presence of fluidic shear stress in dynamic cellular environment.  From previous studies, it suggested that fluidic shear stress stimulated specific endocytosis and prompted cell signaling pathway.  The cellular interactions between NPs and cells in drug delivery should be carefully investigated in presence of shear stress which is one of crit. factors to show the difference of in vitro and in vivo drug distribution and therapy.  The shear-activated drug delivery using NPs were also the scope of this review.\n",

      "Atherosclerosis results in the narrowing of arterial blood vessels and this causes significant changes in the endogenous shear stress between healthy and constricted arteries.  Nanocontainers that can release drugs locally with such rheol. changes can be very useful.  Here, we show that vesicles made from an artificial 1,3-diaminophospholipid are stable under static conditions but release their contents at elevated shear stress.  These vesicles have a lenticular morphol., which potentially leads to instabilities along their equator.  Using a model cardiovascular system based on polymer tubes and an external pump to represent shear stress in healthy and constricted vessels of the heart, we show that drugs preferentially release from the vesicles in constricted vessels that have high shear stress.\n",

      "A review.  Stenosed segments of arteries significantly alter the blood flow known from healthy vessels.  In particular, the wall shear stress at critically stenosed arteries is at least an order of magnitude higher than in healthy situations.  This alteration represents a change in phys. force and might be used as a trigger signal for drug delivery.  Mechano-sensitive drug delivery systems that preferentially release their payload under increased shear stress are discussed.  Therefore, besides biol. or chem. markers, phys. triggers are a further principle approach for targeted drug delivery.  The authors hypothesize that such a phys. trigger is much more powerful to release drugs for vasodilation, plaque stabilization, or clot lysis at stenosed arteries than any known biol. or chem. ones.\n",

      "In this review we focus on shear targeted drug delivery as a novel strategy to selectively deliver drugs to sites of vascular obstruction.  We review the physics of stenotic (abnormally narrowed) blood vessels, while focusing mainly on the hemodynamics and transport phenomena at these sites.  We then discuss how the local abnormal levels of shear stress, which can mechanically activate platelets, can be leveraged for localized drug delivery.  We describe the development of Shear Activated Nano-particle Aggregates (SA-NPAs) that are designed to release and localize their nanoparticle drug carriers at sites of vascular stenosis.  We present results in a variety of in vivo models, demonstrating the superiority of SA-NPAs carrying a thrombolytic drug compared to conventional treatment with the free drug.  We also describe, shear-stress sensitive lenticular liposomes, which also show selective release under stenotic flow conditions.  We then discuss limitations of both technologies, challenges in this new field and potential future applications.  Altogether, we believe that mechano-sensitive therapeutics may offer a potential new approach for treatment of cardiovascular diseases.\n",

      "Obstruction of crit. blood vessels due to thrombosis or embolism is a leading cause of death worldwide.  Here, we describe a biomimetic strategy that uses high shear stress caused by vascular narrowing as a targeting mechanism-in the same way platelets do-to deliver drugs to obstructed blood vessels.  Microscale aggregates of nanoparticles were fabricated to break up into nanoscale components when exposed to abnormally high fluid shear stress.  When coated with tissue plasminogen activator and administered i.v. in mice, these shear-activated nanotherapeutics induce rapid clot dissoln. in a mesenteric injury model, restore normal flow dynamics, and increase survival in an otherwise fatal mouse pulmonary embolism model.  This biophys. strategy for drug targeting, which lowers required doses and minimizes side effects while maximizing drug efficacy, offers a potential new approach for treatment of life-threatening diseases that result from acute vascular occlusion.\n",

      "Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) studies of monolayers of biomols. at an air-water interface give quant. information of in-plane packing, coherence length of cryst. domains, etc.  Rheo-GIXD measurements can reveal quant. changes in the nanocryst. domains of a monolayer under shear.  Here, we report GIXD studies of monolayers of alamethicin peptide, DPPC lipid, and their mixts. at an air-water interface under steady shear stress.  The alamethicin monolayer and the mixed monolayer show a flow jamming transition.  On the other hand, the pure 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) monolayer under const. stress flows steadily with a notable enhancement of the area/mol. and coherence lengths, suggesting the fusion of nanocrystallites during flow.  The DPPC-alamethicin mixed monolayer shows no significant change in the area/DPPC mol., but the coherence lengths of the individual phases (DPPC and alamethicin) increase, suggesting that the crystallites of individual phases grow bigger by merging of domains.  More phase sepn. occurs in the system during flow.  Our results show that rheo-GIXD has the potential to explore in situ mol. structural changes under rheol. conditions for a diverse range of confined biomols. at interfaces.\n",

      "The elemental distribution and local structure of single InxGa1-xN nanowires (NWs) grown by MBE on Si (111) substrates using x-ray fluorescence nanoprobe is reported.  Ga and In maps reveal an inhomogeneous elemental distribution along the NWs, with a higher Ga concn. at the bottom of the NW.  SEM images show that the inhomogeneous axial distribution is not correlated with a x-ray beam induced damage, and therefore, should be an intrinsic characteristic of the NWs arising from the growth process.  Spatially resolved x-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy data acquired around the In K-edge show that the tetrahedral structure is preserved around the absorbing In-atoms all along the NW, and suggests that the compositional modulation could be affecting its long-range order.

      "Worldwide research activity at the nanoscale is triggering the appearance of new, and frequently surprising, materials properties in which the increasing importance of surface and interface effects plays a fundamental role.  This opens further possibilities in the development of new multifunctional materials with tuned phys. properties that do not arise together at the bulk scale.  Unfortunately, the std. methods currently available for solving the at. structure of bulk crystals fail for nanomaterials due to nanoscale effects (very small crystallite sizes, large surface-to-vol. ratio, near-surface relaxation, local lattice distortions etc.).  As a consequence, a crit. reexamn. of the available local-structure characterization methods is needed.  This work discusses the real possibilities and limits of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) anal. at the nanoscale.  To this end, the present state of the art for the interpretation of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) is described, including an advanced approach based on the use of classical mol. dynamics and its application to nickel oxide nanoparticles.  The limits and possibilities of X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) to det. several effects assocd. with the nanocryst. nature of materials are discussed in connection with the development of ZnO-based dil. magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) and iron oxide nanoparticles.\n",

      "In this work, we report on the compn., short- and long-range structural order of single mol. beam epitaxy grown InxGa1-xN nanowires using a hard X-ray synchrotron nanoprobe.  Nano-X-ray fluorescence mapping reveals an axial and radial heterogeneous elemental distribution in the single wires with Ga accumulation at their bottom and outer regions.  Polarization-dependent nano-X-ray absorption near edge structure demonstrates that despite the elemental modulation, the tetrahedral order around the Ga atoms remains along the nanowires.  Nano-X-ray diffraction mapping on single nanowires shows the existence of at least three different phases at their bottom: an In-poor shell and two In-rich phases.  The alloy homogenizes toward the top of the wires, where a single In-rich phase is obsd.  No signatures of In-metallic ppts. are obsd. in the diffraction spectra.  The In-content along the single nanowires estd. from X-ray fluorescence and diffraction data are in good agreement.  A rough picture of these phenomena is briefly presented.  We anticipate that this methodol. will contribute to a greater understanding of the underlying growth concepts not only of nanowires but also of many nanostructures in materials science.\n",

      "The usefulness of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles has led to their wide distribution in consumer products, despite only a limited understanding of how this nanomaterial behaves within biol. systems.  From a nanotoxicol. viewpoint the interaction(s) of ZnO nanoparticles with cells of the immune system is of specific interest, as these nanostructures are readily phagocytosed.  In this study, rapid scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy was used to assay the no. ZnO nanoparticles assocd. with ∼1000 individual THP-1 monocyte-derived human macrophages.  These data showed that nanoparticle-treated cells endured a 400% elevation in total Zn levels, 13-fold greater than the increase obsd. when incubated in the presence of an equitoxic concn. of ZnCl2.  Even after excluding the contribution of internalized nanoparticles, Zn levels in nanoparticle treated cells were raised ∼200% above basal levels.  As dissoln. of ZnO nanoparticles is crit. to their cytotoxic response, we utilized a strategy combining ion beam milling, X-ray fluorescence and SEM to directly probe the distribution and compn. of ZnO nanoparticles throughout the cellular interior.  This study demonstrated that correlative photon and ion beam imaging techniques can provide both high-resoln. and statistically powerful information on the biol. of metal oxide nanoparticles at the single-cell level.  Our approach promises ready application to broader studies of phenomena at the interface of nanotechnol. and biol.\n",

      "The high brilliance of third-generation synchrotron sources increases the demand for faster detectors to utilize the available flux.  The Maia detector is an advanced imaging scheme for energy-dispersive detection realizing dwell times per image-pixel as low as 50μs and count rates higher than 10 × 106 s-1.  In this article the integration of such a Maia detector in the Microprobe setup of beamline P06 at the storage ring PETRA III at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, Germany, is described.  The anal. performance of the complete system in terms of rate-dependent energy resoln., scanning-speed-dependent spatial resoln. and lower limits of detection is characterized.  The potential of the Maia-based setup is demonstrated by key applications from materials science and chem., as well as environmental science with geol. applications and biol. questions that have been investigated at the P06 beamline.\n",

      "Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) have become std. tools to measure element concn., distribution at micrometer- to nanometer-scale, and speciation (e.g., nature of host phase; oxidn. state) in inhomogeneous geomaterials.  The new Maia X-ray detector system provides a quantum leap for the method in terms of data acquisition rate.  It is now possible to rapidly collect fully quant. maps of the distribution of major and trace elements at micrometer spatial resoln. over areas as large as 1 × 5 cm2.  Fast data acquisition rates also open the way to X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) imaging, in which spectroscopic information is available at each pixel in the map.  These capabilities are crit. for studying inhomogeneous Earth materials.  Using a 96-element prototype Maia detector, the authors imaged thin sections of an oxidized pisolitic regolith (2 × 4.5 mm2 at 2.5 × 2.5 μm2 pixel size) and a metamorphosed, sedimentary exhalative Mn-Fe ore (3.3 × 4 mm2 at 1.25 × 5 μm2).  In both cases, As K-edge XANES imaging reveals localized occurrence of reduced As in parts of these oxidized samples, which would have been difficult to recognize using traditional approaches.\n",

      "Besides conventional scanning X-ray fluorescence imaging at synchrotron sources, full-field X-ray fluorescence (FF-XRF) imaging techniques that do not implicitly require spatial scanning of the sample have become available.  FF-XRF has become achievable thanks to the development of a new type of energy dispersive CCD-based 2D detector, also referred to as a 'color X-ray camera (CXC)' or 'SLcam'.  We report on different imaging schemes for biol. samples using FF-XRF imaging: (a) 2D 'zoom' imaging with pinhole optics using the 'camera obscura' principle; (b) 2D 'fixed magnification' imaging using magnifying polycapillary optics; and (c) 3D-FF-XRF imaging using an X-ray sheet beam or computed tomog. (CT).  The different FF-XRF imaging modes are illustrated using the crustacean Daphnia magna, a model organism for investigating the effects of metals on organism/ecosystem health, and foraminifera, a class of amoeboid protist.  Detailed anal. characterization of the set-up is performed through analyzing various ref. materials in order to det. limits of detection (LODs) and sensitivities.  Expts. were performed using the BAMline at the BESSY synchrotron (Berlin, Germany) and using the P06 Hard X-ray Microprobe at the PETRAIII synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany).\n",

      "This review evaluates the role of dose rate on cell and mol. responses.  It focuses on the influence of dose rate on key events in crit. pathways in the development of cancer.  This approach is similar to that used by the U.  S. EPA and others to evaluate risk from chems.  It provides a mechanistic method to account for the influence of the dose rate from low-LET radiation, esp. in the low-dose region on cancer risk assessment.  Mol., cellular, and tissues changes are obsd. in many key events and change as a function of dose rate.  The magnitude and direction of change can be used to help establish an appropriate dose rate effectiveness factor (DREF).  Extensive data on key events suggest that exposure to low dose-rates are less effective in producing changes than high dose rates.  Most of these data at the mol. and cellular level support a large (2-30) DREF.  In addn., some evidence suggests that doses delivered at a low dose rate decrease damage to levels below that obsd. in the controls.  However, there are some data human and mechanistic data that support a dose-rate effectiveness factor of 1.  In summary, a review of the available mol., cellular and tissue data indicates that not only is dose rate an important variable in understanding radiation risk but it also supports the selection of a DREF greater than one as currently recommended by ICRP (2007) and BEIR VII (NRC/NAS 2006).\n",

      "BACKGROUND:  Although CT scans are very useful clinically, potential cancer risks exist from associated ionising radiation, in particular for children who are more radiosensitive than adults.  We aimed to assess the excess risk of leukaemia and brain tumours after CT scans in a cohort of children and young adults.  METHODS:  In our retrospective cohort study, we included patients without previous cancer diagnoses who were first examined with CT in National Health Service (NHS) centres in England, Wales, or Scotland (Great Britain) between 1985 and 2002, when they were younger than 22 years of age.  We obtained data for cancer incidence, mortality, and loss to follow-up from the NHS Central Registry from Jan 1, 1985, to Dec 31, 2008.  We estimated absorbed brain and red bone marrow doses per CT scan in mGy and assessed excess incidence of leukaemia and brain tumours cancer with Poisson relative risk models.  To avoid inclusion of CT scans related to cancer diagnosis, follow-up for leukaemia began 2 years after the first CT and for brain tumours 5 years after the first CT.  FINDINGS:  During follow-up, 74 of 178,604 patients were diagnosed with leukaemia and 135 of 176,587 patients were diagnosed with brain tumours.  We noted a positive association between radiation dose from CT scans and leukaemia (excess relative risk [ERR] per mGy 0·036, 95% CI 0·005-0·120; p=0·0097) and brain tumours (0·023, 0·010-0·049; p<0·0001).  Compared with patients who received a dose of less than 5 mGy, the relative risk of leukaemia for patients who received a cumulative dose of at least 30 mGy (mean dose 51·13 mGy) was 3·18 (95% CI 1·46-6·94) and the relative risk of brain cancer for patients who received a cumulative dose of 50-74 mGy (mean dose 60·42 mGy) was 2·82 (1·33-6·03).  INTERPRETATION:  Use of CT scans in children to deliver cumulative doses of about 50 mGy might almost triple the risk of leukaemia and doses of about 60 mGy might triple the risk of brain cancer.  Because these cancers are relatively rare, the cumulative absolute risks are small: in the 10 years after the first scan for patients younger than 10 years, one excess case of leukaemia and one excess case of brain tumour per 10,000 head CT scans is estimated to occur.  Nevertheless, although clinical benefits should outweigh the small absolute risks, radiation doses from CT scans ought to be kept as low as possible and alternative procedures, which do not involve ionising radiation, should be considered if appropriate.

      "Occupational X-ray examn. programs have been conducted in many countries to screen for occupational and nonoccupational respiratory diseases, resulting in widespread exposure to X-radiation.  We conducted a multicentre case-control study of lung cancer in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia and Slovakia, including 2,589 cases and 2,859 controls enrolled during 1998-2002.  We collected detailed information on occupational X-ray examns., occupations and tobacco smoking.  We calcd. odds ratios of lung cancer via multiple logistic regression after adjustment for age, sex, center and tobacco smoking.  Among controls 24.9% reported no X-ray examn., 62.9% reported 1-30 examns. and 12.2% reported more than 30 examns.  When we chose individuals with no examn. as the ref. group, the odds ratios of lung cancer were 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.48), 1.33 (95% CI 1.08-1.64), 1.49 (95% CI 1.18-1.87), 1.52 (95% CI 1.17-1.99) and 2.15 (95% CI 1.50-3.08) for 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40 and more than 40 examns., resp. (p-value of test for linear trend <0.0001).  The assocn. between X-ray examns. and lung cancer risk was strong in countries with low prevalence of exposure and absent in countries with high prevalence of exposure.  Odds ratios for X-ray examns. were lower among smokers than among nonsmokers.  The magnitude of the increased risk obsd. is higher than expected on the basis of other studies of radiation-exposed populations.  Although the assocn. we detected between X-ray examns. and lung cancer risk may reflect a carcinogenic effect of repeated exposure to low-level ionizing radiation, reporting bias and particularly uncontrolled confounding by occupational exposure to carcinogens are also likely explanations of the results.\n",

      "Normal tissue responses to ionizing radiation have been a major subject for study since the discovery of X-rays at the end of the 19th century.  Shortly thereafter, time-dose relationships were established for some normal tissue endpoints that led to investigations into how the size of dose per fraction and the quality of radiation affected outcome.  The assessment of the radiosensitivity of bone marrow stem cells using colony-forming assays by Till and McCulloch prompted the establishment of in situ clonogenic assays for other tissues that added to the radiobiology toolbox.  These clonogenic and functional endpoints enabled mathematical modeling to be performed that elucidated how tissue structure, and in particular turnover time, impacted clinically relevant fractionated radiation schedules.  More recently, lineage tracing technology, advanced imaging and single cell sequencing have shed further light on the behavior of cells within stem, and other, cellular compartments, both in homeostasis and after radiation damage.  The discovery of heterogeneity within the stem cell compartment and plasticity in response to injury have added new dimensions to the consideration of radiation-induced tissue damage.  Clinically, radiobiology of the 20th century garnered wisdom relevant to photon treatments delivered to a fairly wide field at around 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week, for 5-7 weeks.  Recently, the scope of radiobiology has been extended by advances in technology, imaging and computing, as well as by the use of charged particles.  These allow radiation to be delivered more precisely to tumors while minimizing the amount of normal tissue receiving high doses.  One result has been an increase in the use of schedules with higher doses per fraction given in a shorter time frame (hypofractionation).  We are unable to cover these new technologies in detail in this review, just as we must omit low-dose stochastic effects, and many aspects of dose, dose rate and radiation quality.  We argue that structural diversity and plasticity within tissue compartments provides a general context for discussion of most radiation responses, while acknowledging many omissions. © 2020 The Authors.

      "A wide variety of radiation-induced deterministic skin effects have been observed after X-ray guided interventions ranging from mild effects, such as transient erythema or temporary epilation, to severe effects, such as desquamation and necrosis.  Radiation biologists have identified, in addition to absorbed dose to the skin, other factors that strongly influence the type and severity of a skin reaction, including exposure-related factors (dose rate, fractionation, the size of the exposed area and its site), biological factors (age, oxygen status, capillary density, hormonal status and genetic factors) and ethnic differences.  A peak entrance skin dose of 2 Gy is an arbitrary, but pragmatic, threshold for radiation-induced skin effects after X-ray guided interventions.  Transient skin injury originating in the epidermis is not expected in the average patient population at peak entrance skin doses up to 6 Gy.  Serious skin effects are not likely to occur in clinical practice when optimised X-ray equipment is used in combination with good techniques for fluoroscopy and imaging.  However, this might not be true for patients with biological factors that are associated with an increased sensitivity for radiation-induced skin reactions.\n",

      "The skin is an external organ that is most frequently exposed to radiation.  High-dose radiation initiates and promotes acute radiation injury.  Thus, it is important to investigate the influence of high-dose radiation exposure on the skin at the mol. level.  The post-translational modification of p53 plays a central role in radiation responses, including apoptosis and cell growth arrest.  Although it is well known that ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) can phosphorylate Ser15/Ser18 of p53 in vitro, the post-translational modification pattern and the modifier of p53 in the skin after exposure to high-dose X-rays are not yet well understood.  Here we show that the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15/Ser18, as well as the phosphorylation of histone H2AX on Ser139, was detected in the keratinocytes of the mouse skin and human skin models after high-dose x-ray irradn.  Following high-dose x-ray irradn., both proteins were also phosphorylated in the skin keratinocytes of both ATM gene knockout mice and DNA-PK-deficient SCID mice.\n",

      "BACKGROUND:  Radiation therapy is generally contraindicated for cancer patients with collagen vascular diseases (CVD) such as scleroderma due to an increased risk of fibrosis.  The tight skin (TSK) mouse has skin which, in some respects, mimics that of patients with scleroderma.  The skin radiation response of TSK mice has not been previously reported.  If TSK mice are shown to have radiation sensitive skin, they may prove to be a useful model to examine the mechanisms underlying skin radiation injury, protection, mitigation and treatment.  METHODS:  The hind limbs of TSK and parental control C57BL/6 mice received a radiation exposure sufficient to cause approximately the same level of acute injury.  Endpoints included skin damage scored using a non-linear, semi-quantitative scale and tissue fibrosis assessed by measuring passive leg extension.  In addition, TGF-beta1 cytokine levels were measured monthly in skin tissue.  RESULTS:  Contrary to our expectations, TSK mice were more resistant (i.e. 20%) to radiation than parental control mice.  Although acute skin reactions were similar in both mouse strains, radiation injury in TSK mice continued to decrease with time such that several months after radiation there was significantly less skin damage and leg contraction compared to C57BL/6 mice (p < 0.05).  Consistent with the expected association of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) with late tissue injury, levels of the cytokine were significantly higher in the skin of the C57BL/6 mouse compared to TSK mouse at all time points (p < 0.05).  CONCLUSION:  TSK mice are not recommended as a model of scleroderma involving radiation injury.  The genetic and molecular basis for reduced radiation injury observed in TSK mice warrants further investigation particularly to identify mechanisms capable of reducing tissue fibrosis after radiation injury.\n",

      "The aim of the present study was to establish a rat model of local and systemic bone injury by focal irradn., in order to study the etiol. mechanism and intervention.  Furthermore, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were isolated and induced to osteoclasts.  It has been demonstrated that a single dose of 2 Gy may result in a significant loss of lumbar bone d. at 3 days post-irradn., however this is restored at 30 days post-irradn.  In the 3x8 Gy irradn. rat model, there was a rapid decrease in the aBMd of lumbar spine at 3 days and at 7 days post-irradn., and the aBMd decline persisted even at 60 days post-irradn.  In addn., microcT anal. revealed a persistent decline in bone vol. and damage in microarchitecture in the 3x8 Gy irradn. model, accompanied by a decrease in MAR, index of the decline in bone-forming ability.  In the cellular mechanism, a single 2 Gy local irradn. mainly manifested as an enhancement of the BMMs osteoclastogenesis potential, which was different from the osteoclastogenesis inhibition after high-dose focal irradn. (3x8 Gy).  In summary, the irradn. with simulated clin. focal fractionated radiotherapy exerts short- and long-term systemic injury on bone tissue, characterized by different osteoclastogenesis potential between the high dose mode and a single 2 Gy focal irradn.  Physicians must consider the irreversibility of bone damage in clin. radiotherapy.\n",

      "The development of circular RNA (circRNA) microarrays has facilitated studies on the role of circRNAs in regulating gene expression through a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network.  In our study, a microarray was used to detect the expression profiles of circRNAs in mouse bone marrow stromal cell (MSCs) after total body irradn. (TBI) in an X-ray field.  Forty mice were randomly distributed into two groups, the control group and the TBI group, with 20 mice in each.  Using circRNA microarray data, we compared the circRNA expression profiles in the MSCs between the two groups.  Randomly chosen differentially expressed circRNAs were validated as potential TBI biomarkers.  Overall, 148 circRNAs were significantly upregulated while the other 133 were downregulated between the TBI group and the sham group.  Among them, two upregulated circRNAs (mmu_circRNA_011235 and mmu_circRNA_016901) and three downregulated circRNAs (mmu_circRNA_008488, mmu_circRNA_000551 and mmu_circRNA_005365) exhibited trends comparable to microarray data in the validation expts.  The miRNA support vector regression method was used to predict potential target miRNAs for the circRNAs while ClueGO was used for functional anal. of predicted miRNA target genes.  This is the first study to investigate the differential circRNA expression profile in TBI and the assocd. functions.  Significantly upregulated or downregulated circRNAs may represent novel biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for the clin. management of radiation injury with TBI.\n",

      "Biomols. can act as functional templates for the organization of inorg. particles.  Here we use two protein containers, engineered with opposite surface charge, as building blocks for the construction of a new type of biohybrid material.  Binary structures with cryst. order were obtained, adopting a tetragonal lattice.  Moreover, the cavity of the engineered protein containers can be filled with inorg. nanoparticles.  The controlled assembly of these protein-nanoparticle composites yields highly ordered binary nanoparticle superlattices as free-standing crystals, with up to a few hundred micrometers in size.  Because the structure and lattice parameters of the protein-nanoparticle crystals are independent of their nanoparticle cargo, the binary protein material may serve as a generally applicable matrix for the assembly of a variety of nanoparticles types.\n",

      "With the continuing development of beamlines for macromol. crystallog. (MX) over the last few years providing ever higher X-ray flux densities, it has become even more important to be aware of the effects of radiation damage on the resulting structures.  Nine papers in this issue cover a range of aspects related to the physics and chem. of the manifestations of this damage, as obsd. in both MX and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on crystals, solns. and tissue samples.  The reports include measurements of the heating caused by X-ray irradn. in ruby microcrystals, low-dose expts. examg. damage rates as a function of incident X-ray energy up to 30 keV on a metallo-enzyme using a CdTe detector of high quantum efficiency as well as a theor. anal. of the gains predicted in diffraction efficiency using these detectors, a SAXS examn. of low-dose radiation exposure effects on the dissocn. of a protein complex related to human health, theor. calcns. describing radiation chem. pathways which aim to explain the specific structural damage widely obsd. in proteins, investigation of radiation-induced damage effects in a DNA crystal, a case study on a metallo-enzyme where structural movements thought to be mechanism related might actually be radiation-damage-induced changes, and finally a review describing what X-ray radiation-induced cysteine modifications can teach us about protein dynamics and catalysis.  These papers, along with some other relevant literature published since the last Journal of Synchrotron Radiation Radiation Damage special issue in 2017, are briefly summarized below.\n",

Radiation damage inflicted during diffraction data collection in macromol. crystallog. has re-emerged in the last decade as a major exptl. and computational challenge, as even for crystals held at 100 K it can result in severe data-quality degrdn. and the appearance in solved structures of artifacts which affect biol. interpretations.  Here, the observable symptoms and basic phys. processes involved in radiation damage are described and the concept of absorbed dose as the basic metric against which to monitor the exptl. obsd. changes is outlined.

      "A review.  Many advances in the understanding of radiation damage to protein crystals, particularly at cryogenic temps., have been made in recent years, but with this comes an expanding literature, and, to the new breed of protein crystallographer who is not really interested in X-ray physics or radiation chem. but just wants to solve a biol. relevant structure, the tech. nature and breadth of this literature can be daunting.  The purpose of this paper is to serve as a rough guide to radiation damage issues, and to provide refs. to the more exacting and detailed work.  No attempt has been made to report precise nos. (a factor of two is considered satisfactory), and, since there are aspects of radiation damage that are demonstrably unpredictable, the 'worst case scenario' as well as the 'av. crystal' are discussed in terms of the practicalities of data collection.\n",

      "Radiation damage to cryocooled protein crystals during x-ray structure detn. has become an inherent part of macromol. diffraction data collection at third-generation synchrotrons.  Generally, radiation damage is an undesirable component of the expt. and can result in erroneous structural detail in the final model.  The characterization of radiation damage thus has become an important area for structural biologists.  The calcd. dose limit of 2 × 107 Gy for the diffracting power of cryocooled protein crystals to drop by half has been exptl. evaluated at a third-generation synchrotron source.  Successive data sets were collected from four holoferritin and three apoferritin crystals.  The absorbed dose for each crystal was calcd. by using the program RADDOSE after measurement of the incident photon flux and detn. of the elemental crystal compn. by microparticle-induced x-ray emission.  Degrdn. in diffraction quality and specific structural changes induced by synchrotron radiation then could be compared directly with absorbed dose for different dose/dose rate regimes: a 10% lifetime decrease for a 10-fold dose rate increase was obsd.  Remarkable agreement both between different crystals of the same type and between apoferritin and holoferritin was obsd. for the dose required to reduce the diffracted intensity by half (D1/2).  From these measurements, a dose limit of D1/2 = 4.3 (±0.3) × 107 Gy was obtained.  However, by considering other data quality indicators, an intensity redn. to Iln2 = ln2 × I0, corresponding to an absorbed dose of 3.0 × 107 Gy, is recommended as an appropriate dose limit for typical macromol. crystallog. expts.\n",

      "We report a new method to probe the solid-liq. interface through the use of a thin liq. layer on a solid surface.  An ambient pressure XPS (AP-XPS) endstation that is capable of detecting high kinetic energy photoelectrons (7 keV) at a pressure up to 110 Torr has been constructed and commissioned.  Addnl., we have deployed a \"dip & pull\" method to create a stable nanometers-thick aq. electrolyte on platinum working electrode surface.  Combining the newly constructed AP-XPS system, \"dip & pull\" approach, with a \"tender\" X-ray synchrotron source (2 keV-7 keV), we are able to access the interface between liq. and solid dense phases with photoelectrons and directly probe important phenomena occurring at the narrow solid-liq. interface region in an electrochem. system.  Using this approach, we have performed electrochem. oxidn. of the Pt electrode at an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential.  Under this potential, we observe the formation of both Pt2+ and Pt4+ interfacial species on the Pt working electrode in situ.  We believe this thin-film approach and the use of \"tender\" AP-XPS highlighted in this study is an innovative new approach to probe this key solid-liq. interface region of electrochem.\n",

      "An approach is demonstrated to obtain, in a sample- and time-efficient manner, multiple dose-resolved crystal structures from room-temp. protein microcrystals using identical fixed-target supports at both synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs).  This approach allows direct comparison of dose-resolved serial synchrotron and damage-free XFEL serial femtosecond crystallog. structures of radiation-sensitive proteins.  Specifically, serial synchrotron structures of a heme peroxidase enzyme reveal that X-ray induced changes occur at far lower doses than those at which diffraction quality is compromised (the Garman limit), consistent with previous studies on the redn. of heme proteins by low X-ray doses.  In these structures, a functionally relevant bond length is shown to vary rapidly as a function of absorbed dose, with all room-temp. synchrotron structures exhibiting linear deformation of the active site compared with the XFEL structure.  It is demonstrated that extrapolation of dose-dependent synchrotron structures to zero dose can closely approx. the damage-free XFEL structure.  This approach is widely applicable to any protein where the crystal structure is altered by the synchrotron X-ray beam and provides a soln. to the urgent requirement to det. intact structures of such proteins in a high-throughput and accessible manner.\n",

      "A phys. approach was used to analyze the various mechanisms induced by the absorption of x-ray photons of energies in the 0.2-20keV range.  At the at. scale, besides the (Auger and photo) electron transport in the bulk or the ejection into the surrounding media, special attention in devoted to the specific consequences of the initial Auger decay mechanism.  At the macroscopic scale, the decisive role of the poor electronic cond. of the radiation-sensitive materials is outlined and the damaging effects occur in irradiated insulators because the lack of conduction electrons prevents the initial charge of the excited atoms being quickly restored.  Correlating irradn. conditions and phys. properties of the specimen, various expressions are proposed for the 1st time to quantify these effects.  Some are neither dose-nor dose-rate-dependent and the influence of the surrounding medium is also considered.  The fundamental mechanisms studied here hold for a wide variety of specimens or components studied in x-ray microscopy.  Their consequences can be easily transposed to other techniques using transmitted x-rays.\n",

      "X-ray radiation damage of lysozyme single crystals by an intense monochromatic beam from the Advanced Photon Source was studied at cryogenic temps. of 40-150 K.  The results confirmed that primary radiation damage was both linearly dependent on the x-ray dose and independent of temp.  The upper limit for the primary radiation damage obsd. in the authors' previous study [T. Teng and K. Moffat (2000)] held over the wider temp. range of this study.  The x-ray diffraction quality of the data acquired at 40 K was superior to those at 100 K, apparently due to temp. dependence of secondary and tertiary radiation damage and to reduced thermal motion.\n",

      "X-ray diffraction microscopy (XDM) is a new form of X-ray imaging that is being practiced at several third-generation synchrotron-radiation X-ray facilities.  Nine years have elapsed since the technique was first introduced and it has made rapid progress in demonstrating high-resoln. three-dimensional imaging and promises few-nanometer resoln. with much larger samples than can be imaged in the transmission electron microscope.  Both life- and materials-science applications of XDM are intended, and it is expected that the principal limitation to resoln. will be radiation damage for life science and the coherent power of available X-ray sources for material science.  In this paper we address the question of the role of radiation damage.  We use a statistical anal. based on the so-called \"dose fractionation theorem\" of Hegerl and Hoppe to calc. the dose needed to make an image of a single life-science sample by XDM with a given resoln.  We find that the needed dose scales with the inverse fourth power of the resoln. and present exptl. evidence to support this finding.  To det. the max. tolerable dose we have assembled a no. of data taken from the literature plus some measurements of our own which cover ranges of resoln. that are not well covered otherwise.  The conclusion of this study is that, based on the natural contrast between protein and water and \"Rose-criterion\" image quality, one should be able to image a frozen-hydrated biol. sample using XDM at a resoln. of about 10 nm.\n",

      "Flow cytometry and cell sorting techniques have been used together with repeated measurement in an attempt to define better the radiation survival response of asynchronously dividing Chinese hamster V79-171 cells under aerobic and hypoxic conditions.  Although the first two decades of cell inactivation have been examined, particular attention has been given to the low-dose range of a few grays, as used in individual radiation therapy treatments.  A single linear-quadratic dose-response function was consistently unable to fit both the low-dose and high-dose data satisfactorily, suggesting a two-component response.  Separate fitting of the low-dose and high-dose portions of the response yielded alpha and beta values which differed significantly (P = 0.001 to 0.002).  The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the observed substructure simply reflects the presence of subpopulations of sensitive (G1-, G2-phase) and resistant (late S-phase) cells, which are resolved in these measurements.  These results may have significance for certain situations in radiation therapy and in biophysical modeling of the radiation response.\n",

      "X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy features unique capabilities which make it well suited for biol. investigations.  Its high sensitivity together with high spatial resoln. and penetration depth provide a unique tool for trace elements anal. in heterogeneous samples.  Like most of the x-ray based techniques, radiation damage sets hard limits on the ultimate performance.  Although the interactions between matter and photons are well described from a physics point-of-view, there is a lack of exptl. data, in particular for XRF imaging mode.  In this context, this work proposes a practical approach in addressing the limits set by radiation damage to x-ray fluorescence imaging in the case of hydrated and unfixed cells at room temp.  The max. dose tolerated by ascidian blood cells is 105 Gy.  A simple theor. model allowed the minimal doses required for a good image contrast to be detd. for various exptl. schemes.  The results are consistent with the exptl. observation on ascidian blood cells which exemplifies the peculiar case of highly concd. samples (>10,000 ppm) at room temp.  The same simple model predicts that in the case of the detection of high Z trace elements in cryopreserved cells, the relative detection limit set by radiation damage is below 0.1 ppm at a spatial resoln. of 100 nm.\n",

      "X-ray radiation damage of a lysozyme single crystal by an intense monochromatic beam from a third-generation radiation source at the Advanced Photon Source has been studied.  The results show that primary radiation damage is linearly dependent on the X-ray dose even when the crystal is at cryogenic temps.  The existence of an upper limit for the primary radiation damage was obsd.  Above the threshold of approx. 1 × 107 Gy, excessive damage of the crystal develops which is interpreted as the onset of secondary and/or tertiary radiation damage.  This upper limit of X-ray dose is compared with Henderson's limit [Henderson (1990) Proc. R. Soc. London, B241, 6-8], and its implication for the amt. of useful X-ray diffraction data that can be obtained for crystals of a given scattering power is also discussed.\n",

      "The resoln. of transmission x-ray microscopes (TXMs) using zone plate optics is presently about 30 nm.  Theory and expts. presented here show that this resoln. can be obtained in radiation sensitive hydrated biol. material by using shock frozen samples.  For this purpose the interaction of X-rays with matter and the image formation with zone plates is described.  For the first time the influence of the limited apertures of the condenser and the zone plate objective are in included in calcns. of the image contrast, the photon d. and radiation dose required for the object illumination.  Model considerations show that lowest radiation dose and high image contrast are obtained in optimized phase contrast which exploits absorption as well as phase shift.  The damaging effect of the absorbed X-rays is quant. evaluated by radiation-induced kinetics showing that cryogenic samples are structurally stable.  To verify these theor. models the TXM was modified to allow imaging of frozen-hydrated samples at atm. pressure.  Details inside cells and algae as small as 35 nm are visible at 2.4 nm wavelength in amplitude contrast mode.  At this resoln. the cryogenic samples show no structural changes.  As predicted, optimized phase contrast shows structures inside the frozen-hydrated objects with high contrast.  Stereo-pair images of algae reveal the 3D organization of the organelles.  Element anal. and micro-tomog. of whole cryogenic cells are possible.\n",

      "Hard X-ray fluorescence microscopy is one of the most sensitive techniques for performing trace elemental anal. of biol. samples such as whole cells and tissues.  Conventional sample prepn. methods usually involve dehydration, which removes cellular water and may consequently cause structural collapse, or invasive processes such as embedding.  Radiation-induced artifacts may also become an issue, particularly as the spatial resoln. increases beyond the sub-micrometer scale.  To allow imaging under hydrated conditions, close to the 'natural state', as well as to reduce structural radiation damage, the Bionanoprobe (BNP) has been developed, a hard X-ray fluorescence nanoprobe with cryogenic sample environment and cryo transfer capabilities, dedicated to studying trace elements in frozen-hydrated biol. systems.  The BNP is installed at an undulator beamline at sector 21 of the Advanced Photon Source.  It provides a spatial resoln. of 30 nm for two-dimensional fluorescence imaging.  In this first demonstration the instrument design and motion control principles are described, the instrument performance is quantified, and the first results obtained with the BNP on frozen-hydrated whole cells are reported.\n",

      "Synchrotron radiation based nanoscopic X-ray fluorescence (SR nano-XRF) anal. can visualize trace level elemental distribution in a fully quant. manner within single cells.  However, in-air XRF anal. requires chem. fixation modifying the cell's chem. compn.  Here, we describe first nanoscopic XRF anal. upon cryogenically frozen (-150°C) fibroblasts at the ID16A-NI 'Nano-imaging' end-station located at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (France).  Fibroblast cells were obtained from skin biopsies from control and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) patients.  FRDA is an autosomal recessive disorder with dysregulation of iron metab. as a key feature.  By means of the X-ray Fundamental Parameter (FP) method, including absorption correction of the ice layer deposited onto the fibroblasts, background-cor. mass fraction elemental maps of P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe and Zn of entire cryofrozen human fibroblasts were obtained.  Despite the presence of diffracting microcrystals in the vitreous ice matrix and minor sample radiation damage effects, clusters of iron-rich hot-spots with similar mass fractions were found in the cytoplasm of both control and FRDA fibroblasts.  Interestingly, no significant difference in the mean iron concn. was found in the cytoplasm of FRDA fibroblasts, but a significant decrease in zinc concn.  This finding might underscore metal dysregulation, beyond iron, in cells derived from FRDA patients.  In conclusion, although currently having slightly increased limits of detection (LODs) compared to non-cryogenic mode, SR based nanoscopic XRF under cryogenic sample conditions largely obliterates the debate on chem. sample preservation and provides a unique tool for trace level elemental imaging in single cells close to their native state with a superior spatial resoln. of 20 nm.\n",

      "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generally accepted to be the most biol. significant lesion by which ionizing radiation causes cancer and hereditary disease.  However, no information on the induction and processing of DSBs after physiol. relevant radiation doses is available.  Many of the methods used to measure DSB repair inadvertently introduce this form of damage as part of the methodol., and hence are limited in their sensitivity.  Here we present evidence that foci of γ-H2AX (a phosphorylated histone), detected by immunofluorescence, are quant. the same as DSBs and are capable of quantifying the repair of individual DSBs.  This finding allows the investigation of DSB repair after radiation doses as low as 1 mGy, an improvement by several orders of magnitude over current methods.  Surprisingly, DSBs induced in cultures of nondividing primary human fibroblasts by very low radiation doses (≈1 mGy) remain unrepaired for many days, in strong contrast to efficient DSB repair that is obsd. at higher doses.  However, the level of DSBs in irradiated cultures decreases to that of unirradiated cell cultures if the cells are allowed to proliferate after irradn., and we present evidence that this effect may be caused by an elimination of the cells carrying unrepaired DSBs.  The results presented are in contrast to current models of risk assessment that assume that cellular responses are equally efficient at low and high doses, and provide the opportunity to employ γ-H2AX foci formation as a direct biomarker for human exposure to low quantities of ionizing radiation.\n",

      "To observe the adaptive response (AR) induced by ionizing radiation in human fibroblasts under monolayer and 3-dimensional (3-D) condition.  Three kinds of fibroblasts were cultured under both monolayer and 3-D condition.  Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect the γ-H2AX foci and the morphol. texture.  Trypan blue staining was used to detect the cell death.  Western blot was used to detect the expressions of γ-H2AX, p53 and CDKN1A/p21 (p21).  We found that DNA damage increased in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner after high doses of radiation.  When cells were pretreated with a priming low dose of radiation followed by high dose radiation, DNA damage was attenuated under both monolayer and 3-D condition, and the adaptive response (AR) was induced.  Addnl., the morphol. of cells under monolayer and 3-D conditions were different, and radiation also induced AR according to morphol. texture anal.  Priming low dose radiation induced AR both under monolayer and 3-D condition.  Interestingly, 3-D microenvironment made cells more sensitive to radiation.  The expression of p53 and p21 was changed and indicated that they might participate in the regulation of AR.\n",

      "There has been enormous recent progress in understanding how human cells respond to oxidative stress, such as that caused by exposure to ionizing radiation.  We have witnessed a significant deciphering of the events that underlie how antioxidant responses counter pro-oxidant damage to key biol. targets in all cellular compartments, including the genome and mitochondria.  These cytoprotective responses include: 1.  The basal cellular repertoire of antioxidant capabilities and its supporting cast of facilitator enzymes; and 2.  The inducible phase of the antioxidant response, notably that mediated by the Nrf2 transcription factor.  There has also been frenetic progress in defining how reactive electrophilic species swamp existing protective mechanisms to augment DNA damage, events that are embodied in the cellular \"DNA-damage response\", including cell cycle checkpoint activation and DNA repair, which occur on a time scale of hours to days, as well as the implementation of cellular responses such as apoptosis, autophagy, senescence and reprograming that extend the time period of damage sensing and response into weeks, months and years.  It has become apparent that, in addn. to the initial oxidative insult, cells typically undergo further waves of secondary reactive oxygen/nitrogen species generation, DNA damage and signaling and that these may reemerge long after the initial events have subsided, probably being driven, at least in part, by persisting DNA damage.  These reactive oxygen/nitrogen species are an integral part of the pathol. consequences of radiation exposure and may persist across multiple cell divisions.  Because of the pervasive nature of oxidative stress, a cell will manifest different responses in different subcellular compartments and to different levels of stress injury.  Aspects of these compartmentalized responses can involve the same proteins (such as ATM, p53 and p21) but in different functional guises, e.g., in cytoplasmic vs. nuclear responses or in early- vs. late-phase events.  Many of these responses involve gene activation and new protein synthesis as well as a plethora of post-translational modifications of both basal and induced response proteins.  It is these responses that we focus on in this review.\n",

      "The immune system has the power to modulate the expression of radiation-induced normal and tumor tissue damage.  On the one hand, it can contribute to cancer cure, and on the other hand, it can influence acute and late radiation side effects, which in many ways resemble acute and chronic inflammatory disease states.  The way radiation-induced inflammation feeds into adaptive antigen-specific immune responses adds another dimension to the tumor-host cross talk during radiation therapy and to possible radiation-driven autoimmune responses.  Understanding how radiation affects inflammation and immunity is therefore critical if we are to effectively manipulate these forces for benefit in radiation oncology treatments.\n",

      "A review.  Therapeutic irradn. of the tumor microenvironment causes differential activation of pro-survival and pro-death pathways in malignant, stromal, endothelial and immune cells, hence causing a profound cellular and biol. reconfiguration via multiple, non-redundant mechanisms.  Such mechanisms include the selective elimination of particularly radiosensitive cell types and consequent loss of specific cellular functions, the local release of cytokines and danger signals by dying radiosensitive cells, and altered cytokine secretion by surviving radioresistant cells.  Altogether, these processes create chemotactic and immunomodulatory cues for incoming and resident immune cells.  Here we discuss how cytoprotective and cytotoxic signaling modules activated by radiation in specific cell populations reshape the immunol. tumor microenvironment.\n",

      "A review.  Radiation is an important component of cancer treatment with more than half of all patients receive radiotherapy during their cancer experience.  While the impact of radiation on tumor morphol. is routinely examd. in the pre-clin. and clin. setting, the impact of radiation on the tumor microenvironment and more specifically the inflammatory/immune response is less well characterized.  Inflammation is a key contributor to short- and long-term cancer eradication, with significant tumor and normal tissue consequences.  Therefore, the role of radiation in modulating the inflammatory response is highly topical given the current wave of targeted and immuno-therapeutic treatments for cancer.  This review provides a general overview of how radiation modulates the inflammatory and immune response-(i) how radiation induces the inflammatory/immune system, (ii) the cellular changes that take place, (iii) how radiation dose delivery affects the immune response, and (iv) a discussion on research directions to improve patient survival, reduce side effects, improve quality of life, and reduce financial costs in the immediate future.  Harnessing the benefits of radiation on the immune response will enhance its maximal therapeutic benefit and reduce radiation-induced toxicity.\n",

      "A review.  Cellular exposure to ionizing radiation leads to oxidizing events that alter at. structure through direct interactions of radiation with target macromols. or via products of water radiolysis.  Further, the oxidative damage may spread from the targeted to neighboring, non-targeted bystander cells through redox-modulated intercellular communication mechanisms.  To cope with the induced stress and the changes in the redox environment, organisms elicit transient responses at the mol., cellular and tissue levels to counteract toxic effects of radiation.  Metabolic pathways are induced during and shortly after the exposure.  Depending on radiation dose, dose-rate and quality, these protective mechanisms may or may not be sufficient to cope with the stress.  When the harmful effects exceed those of homeostatic biochem. processes, induced biol. changes persist and may be propagated to progeny cells.  Physiol. levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species play crit. roles in many cellular functions.  In irradiated cells, levels of these reactive species may be increased due to perturbations in oxidative metab. and chronic inflammatory responses, thereby contributing to the long-term effects of exposure to ionizing radiation on genomic stability.  Here, in addn. to immediate biol. effects of water radiolysis on DNA damage, we also discuss the role of mitochondria in the delayed outcomes of ionization radiation.  Defects in mitochondrial functions lead to accelerated aging and numerous pathol. conditions.  Different types of radiation vary in their linear energy transfer (LET) properties, and we discuss their effects on various aspects of mitochondrial physiol.  These include short and long-term in vitro and in vivo effects on mitochondrial DNA, mitochondrial protein import and metabolic and antioxidant enzymes.\n",

      "Medical imaging has become a central component of patient care to ensure early and accurate diagnosis.  Unfortunately, many imaging modalities use ionizing radiation to generate images.  Ionizing radiation even in low doses can cause direct DNA damage and generate reactive oxygen species and free radicals, leading to DNA, protein, and lipid membrane damage.  This cell damage can lead to apoptosis, necrosis, teratogenesis, or carcinogenesis.  As many as 2% of cancers (and an assocd. 15,000 deaths annually) can be linked to computed tomog. exposure alone.  Radio-protective agents have been investigated using various models including cells, animals, and recently humans.  The data suggest that radioprotective agents working through a variety of mechanisms have the potential to decrease free radical damage produced by ionizing radiation.  Radioprotective agents may be useful as an adjunct to medical imaging to reduced patient morbidity and mortality due to ionizing radiation exposure.  Some radioprotective agents can be found in high quantities in antioxidant rich foods, suggesting that a specific diet recommendation could be beneficial in radioprotection.\n",

      "A review.  Radiotherapy is one of the major therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.  In the past decade, there has been growing interest in using high Z (at. no.) elements (materials) as radiosensitizers.  New strategies in nanomedicine could help to improve cancer diagnosis and therapy at cellular and mol. levels.  Metal-based nanoparticles usually exhibit chem. inertness in cellular and subcellular systems and may play a role in radiosensitization and synergistic cell-killing effects for radiation therapy.  This review summarizes the efficacy of metal-based NanoEnhancers against cancers in both in vitro and in vivo systems for a range of ionizing radiations including gamma-rays, X-rays, and charged particles.  The potential of translating preclin. studies on metal-based nanoparticles-enhanced radiation therapy into clin. practice is also discussed using examples of several metal-based NanoEnhancers (such as CYT-6091, AGuIX, and NBTXR3).  Also, a few general examples of theranostic multimetallic nanocomposites are presented, and the related biol. mechanisms are discussed.\n",

      "Pathol. complete response to preoperative treatment in adults with soft-tissue sarcoma can be achieved in only a few patients receiving radiotherapy.  This phase 2-3 trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of the hafnium oxide (HfO2) nanoparticle NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone as a pre-operative treatment in patients with locally advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.Act.In.  Sarc is a phase 2-3 randomised, multicentre, international trial.  Adults (aged ≥18 years) with locally advanced soft-tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk wall, of any histol. grade, and requiring preoperative radiotherapy were included.  Patients had to have a WHO performance status of 0-2 and a life expectancy of at least 6 mo.  Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive web response system to receive either NBTXR3 (vol. corresponding to 10% of baseline tumor vol. at a fixed concn. of 53·3 g/L) as a single intratumoral administration before preoperative external-beam radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) or radiotherapy alone, followed by surgery.  Randomisation was stratified by histol. subtype (myxoid liposarcoma vs others).  This was an open-label study.  The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a pathol. complete response, assessed by a central pathol. review board following European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer guidelines in the intention-to-treat population full anal. set.  Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one puncture and injection of NBTXR3 or at least one dose of radiotherapy.  This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, no. NCT02379845, and is ongoing for long-term follow-up, but recruitment is complete.  Between March 3, 2015, and Nov 21, 2017, 180 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned and 179 started treatment: 89 in the NBTXR3 plus radiotherapy group and 90 in the radiotherapy alone group.  Two patients in the NBTXR3 group and one patient in the radiotherapy group were excluded from the efficacy anal. because they were subsequently discovered to be ineligible; thus, a total of 176 patients were analyzed for the primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat full anal. set (87 in the NBTXR3 group and 89 in the radiotherapy alone group).  A pathol. complete response was noted in 14 (16%) of 87 patients in the NBTXR3 group and seven (8%) of 89 in the radiotherapy alone group (p=0·044).  In both treatment groups, the most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse event was postoperative wound complication (eight [9%] of 89 patients in the NBTXR3 group and eight [9%] of 90 in the radiotherapy alone group).  The most common grade 3-4 adverse events related to NBTXR3 administration were injection site pain (four [4%] of 89) and hypotension (four [4%]) and the most common grade 3-4 radiotherapy-related adverse event was radiation skin injury in both groups (five [6%] of 89 in the NBTXR3 group and four [4%] of 90 in the radiotherapy alone group).  The most common treatment-emergent grade 3-4 adverse event related to NBTXR3 was hypotension (six [7%] of 89 patients).  Serious adverse events were obsd. in 35 (39%) of 89 patients in the NBTXR3 group and 27 (30%) of 90 patients in the radiotherapy alone group.  No treatment-related deaths occurred.  This trial validates the mode of action of this new class of radioenhancer, which potentially opens a large field of clin. applications in soft-tissue sarcoma and possibly other cancers.\n",

      "X-ray fluorescence computed tomog. (XFCT) is a technique that can identify, quantify, and locate elements within objects by detecting x-ray fluorescence (characteristic x-rays) stimulated by an excitation source, typically derived from a synchrotron.  However, the use of a synchrotron limits practicality and accessibility of XFCT for routine biomedical imaging applications.  Therefore, we have developed the ability to perform XFCT on a benchtop setting with ordinary polychromatic x-ray sources.  Here, we report our postmortem study that demonstrates the use of benchtop XFCT to accurately image the distribution of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) injected into a tumor-bearing mouse.  The distribution of GNPs as detd. by benchtop XFCT was validated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  This investigation shows drastically enhanced sensitivity and specificity of GNP detection and quantification with benchtop XFCT, up to two orders of magnitude better than conventional x-ray CT.  The results also reaffirm the unique capabilities of benchtop XFCT for simultaneous detn. of the spatial distribution and concn. of nonradioactive metallic probes, such as GNPs, within the context of small animal imaging.  Overall, this investigation identifies a clear path toward in vivo mol. imaging using benchtop XFCT techniques in conjunction with GNPs and other metallic probes.\n",

      "A particular challenge for nanotoxicol. is the evaluation of the biol. fate and toxicity of nanomaterials that dissolve in aq. fluids.  Zinc oxide nanomaterials are of particular concern because dissoln. leads to release of the toxic divalent zinc ion.  Although zinc ions have been implicated in ZnO cytotoxicity, direct identification of the chem. form of zinc taken up by cells exposed to ZnO nanoparticles, and its intracellular fate, has not yet been achieved.  We combined high resoln. X-ray spectromicroscopy and high elemental sensitivity X-ray microprobe analyses to det. the fate of ZnO and less sol. iron-doped ZnO nanoparticles following exposure to cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B.  We complemented two-dimensional X-ray imaging methods with at. force microscopy of cell surfaces to distinguish between nanoparticles that were transported inside the cells from those that adhered to the cell exterior.  The data suggest cellular uptake of ZnO nanoparticles is a mechanism of zinc accumulation in cells.  Following uptake, ZnO nanoparticles dissolved completely generating intracellular Zn2+ complexed by mol. ligands.  These results corroborate a model for ZnO nanoparticle toxicity that is based on nanoparticle uptake followed by intracellular dissoln.\n",

      "To investigate the role of particle size on the oxidn., bioavailability, and adverse effects of manufd. Cu nanoparticles (NPs) in soils, we exposed the earthworm Eisenia fetida to a series of concns. of com. produced NPs labeled as 20- to 40-nm or <100-nm Cu in artificial soil media.  Effects on growth, mortality, reprodn., and expression of a variety of genes assocd. with metal homeostasis, general stress, and oxidative stress were measured.  We also used X-ray absorption spectroscopy and scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy to characterize changes in chem. speciation and spatial distribution of the NPs in soil media and earthworm tissues.  Exposure concns. of Cu NPs up to 65 mg kg-1 caused no adverse effects on ecol. relevant endpoints.  Increases in metallothionein expression occurred at concns. exceeding 20 mg kg-1 of Cu NPs and concns. exceeding 10 mg kg-1 of CuSO4.  Based on the relationship of Cu tissue concn. to metallothionein expression level and the spatial distribution and chem. speciation of Cu in the tissues, we conclude that Cu ions and oxidized Cu NPs were taken up by the earthworms.  This study suggests that oxidized Cu NPs may enter food chains from soil but that adverse effects in earthworms are likely to occur only at relatively high concns. (>65 mg Cu kg-1 soil).\n",

      "It is necessary to elucidate cellular internalization and intracellular biotransformation in order to accurately assess the toxicity and fate of nanoparticles after interaction with organisms.  Therefore, this work employed a combination of high resoln. imaging and in situ detection spectroscopic techniques to systematically investigate the intracellular localization, morphol. and chem. speciation of silver in the cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular freshwater green alga, after exposure to AgNPs coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone at a concn. of 2.0 mg/L.  High resoln. secondary ion mass spectrometry and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy together with energy dispersive spectroscopy and selected area electron diffraction collectively confirmed that after 48 h of exposure, AgNPs entered the periplasmic space after cellular internalization into the algal cells.  Silver was also found to coexist with sulfur inside the cytoplasm in both cryst. and amorphous forms, which were further identified as β-Ag2S and silver thiolates with synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy.  In combination, these analyses demonstrated that silver inside algae could be attributed to the uptake and sequestration of Ag+ ion released from AgNPs, which was further sequestrated into cellular compartments.  This study provides solid evidence for particle internalization and biotransformation of AgNPs after interaction with algae.\n",

      "Understanding plant interactions with nanoparticles is of increasing importance for assessing their toxicity and trophic transport.  The primary objective of this study was to assess uptake, biodistribution and toxicity assocd. with exposure of tobacco plants (Nicotiana xanthi) to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).  We employed synchrotron-based X-ray microanal. with X-ray absorption near-edge microspectroscopy and high resoln. electron microscopy to localize AuNPs within plants.  Results from these expts. reveal that AuNPs entered plants through the roots and moved into the vasculature.  Aggregate bodies were also detected within root cell cytoplasm.  Furthermore, AuNP uptake was size selective as 3.5 nm AuNP spheres were detected in plants but 18 nm AuNPs remained agglomerated on the root outer surfaces.  Finally, leaf necrosis was obsd. after 14 days of exposure to 3.5 nm AuNPs.  Overall, results of this work show the potential for AuNPs to enter plants through size-dependent mechanisms, translocate to cells and tissues and cause biotoxicity.\n",

      "While large-scale synchrotron sources provide a highly brilliant monochromatic X-ray beam, these X-ray sources are expensive in terms of installation and maintenance, and require large amounts of space due to the size of storage rings for GeV electrons.  On the other hand, laboratory X-ray tube sources can easily be implemented in laboratories or hospitals with comparatively little cost, but their performance features a lower brilliance and a polychromatic spectrum creates problems with beam hardening artifacts for imaging experiments.  Over the last decade, compact synchrotron sources based on inverse Compton scattering have evolved as one of the most promising types of laboratory-scale X-ray sources: they provide a performance and brilliance that lie in between those of large-scale synchrotron sources and X-ray tube sources, with significantly reduced financial and spatial requirements.  These sources produce X-rays through the collision of relativistic electrons with infrared laser photons.  In this study, an analysis of the performance, such as X-ray flux, source size and spectra, of the first commercially sold compact light source, the Munich Compact Light Source, is presented.\n",

      "Between X-ray tubes and large-scale synchrotron sources, a large gap in performance exists with respect to the monochromaticity and brilliance of the X-ray beam.  However, due to their size and cost, large-scale synchrotrons are not available for more routine applications in small and medium-sized academic or industrial labs.  This gap could be closed by laser-driven compact synchrotron light sources (CLS), which use an IR (IR) laser cavity in combination with a small electron storage ring.  Hard X-rays are produced through the process of inverse Compton scattering upon the intersection of the electron bunch with the focused laser beam.  The produced X-ray beam is intrinsically monochromatic and highly collimated.  This makes a CLS well-suited for applications of more advanced--and more challenging--X-ray imaging approaches, such as X-ray multimodal tomog.  Here we present, to our knowledge, the first results of a first successful demonstration expt. in which a monochromatic X-ray beam from a CLS was used for multimodal, i.e., phase-, dark-field, and attenuation-contrast, X-ray tomog.  We show results from a fluid phantom with different liqs. and a biomedical application example in the form of a multimodal CT scan of a small animal (mouse, ex vivo).  The results highlight particularly that quant. multimodal CT has become feasible with laser-driven CLS, and that the results outperform more conventional approaches.\n",

      "Abstr.: Novel compact x-ray sources based on inverse Compton scattering can generate brilliant hard x-rays in a lab. setting.  Their collimated intense beams with tunable well-defined x-ray energies make them well suited for x-ray spectroscopy techniques, which are typically carried out at large facilities.  Here, we demonstrate a first x-ray absorption spectroscopy proof-of-principle expt. using an inverse Compton x-ray source with a flux of >1010 photons/s in <5% bandwidth.  We measured x-ray absorption near edge structure and extended x-ray absorption fine structure at the silver K-edge (∼25.5 keV) for a series of silver samples.  We propose an energy-dispersive geometry specifically adapted to the x-ray beam properties of inverse Compton x-ray sources together with a fast concn. correction method that corrects sample inhomogeneities very effectively.  The combination of our setup with the inverse Compton source generates x-ray absorption spectra with high energy resoln. in exposure times down to one minute.  Our results unravel the great benefit of inverse Compton scattering sources for x-ray absorption techniques in a lab. environment, esp. in the hard x-ray regime, which allows to probe absorption edges of high Z materials.\n",

      "Mech. ventilation (MV) and supplementation of oxygen-enriched gas, often needed in postnatal resuscitation procedures, are known to be main risk factors for impaired pulmonary development in the preterm and term neonates.  Unfortunately, current imaging modalities lack in sensitivity for the detection of early stage lung injury.  The present study reports a new imaging approach for diagnosis and staging of early lung injury induced by MV and hyperoxia in neonatal mice.  The imaging method is based on the Talbot-Lau x-ray grating interferometry that makes it possible to quantify the x-ray small-angle scattering on the air-tissue interfaces.  This so-called dark-field signal revealed increasing loss of x-ray small-angle scattering when comparing images of neonatal mice undergoing hyperoxia and MV-O2 with animals kept at room air.  The changes in the dark field correlated well with histol. findings and provided superior differentiation than conventional x-ray imaging and lung function testing.  The results suggest that x-ray dark-field radiog. is a sensitive tool for assessing structural changes in the developing lung.  In the future, with further tech. developments x-ray dark-field imaging could be an important tool for earlier diagnosis and sensitive monitoring of lung injury in neonates requiring postnatal oxygen or ventilator therapy.\n",

      "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease with a median life expectancy of 4-5 years after initial diagnosis.  Early diagnosis and accurate monitoring of IPF are limited by a lack of sensitive imaging techniques that are able to visualize early fibrotic changes at the epithelial-mesenchymal interface.  Here, we report a new x-ray imaging approach that directly visualizes the air-tissue interfaces in mice in vivo.  This imaging method is based on the detection of small-angle x-ray scattering that occurs at the air-tissue interfaces in the lung.  Small-angle scattering is detected with a Talbot-Lau interferometer, which provides the so-called x-ray dark-field signal.  Using this imaging modality, we demonstrate-for the first time-the quantification of early pathogenic changes and their correlation with histol. changes, as assessed by stereol. morphometry.  The presented radiog. method is significantly more sensitive in detecting morphol. changes compared with conventional x-ray imaging, and exhibits a significantly lower radiation dose than conventional x-ray CT.  As a result of the improved imaging sensitivity, this new imaging modality could be used in future to reduce the no. of animals required for pulmonary research studies.\n",

      "X-ray chest radiography is an inexpensive and broadly available tool for initial assessment of the lung in clinical routine, but typically lacks diagnostic sensitivity for detection of pulmonary diseases in their early stages.  Recent X-ray dark-field (XDF) imaging studies on mice have shown significant improvements in imaging-based lung diagnostics.  Especially in the case of early diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), XDF imaging clearly outperforms conventional radiography.  However, a translation of this technique towards the investigation of larger mammals and finally humans has not yet been achieved.  In this letter, we present the first in-vivo XDF full-field chest radiographs (32 × 35 cm(2)) of a living pig, acquired with clinically compatible parameters (40 s scan time, approx. 80 μSv dose).  For imaging, we developed a novel high-energy XDF system that overcomes the limitations of currently established setups.  Our XDF radiographs yield sufficiently high image quality to enable radiographic evaluation of the lungs.  We consider this a milestone in the bench-to-bedside translation of XDF imaging and expect XDF imaging to become an invaluable tool in clinical practice, both as a general chest X-ray modality and as a dedicated tool for high-risk patients affected by smoking, industrial work and indoor cooking.\n",

      "An x-ray interferometer has been developed that uses two transmission phase gratings to analyze wave front distortions in the hard x-ray range.  The interferometer is insensitive to mech. drift and vibrations, and it is tunable over a wide range of photon energies.  This setup was used for differential phase contrast imaging of low-absorbing test objects.  We obtained micrographs with moire´ fringes of good visibility, which revealed the local phase shift gradient caused by the objects.

      "First Talbot interferometry in the hard x-ray region was demonstrated using a pair of transmission gratings made by forming Au stripes on glass plates.  By aligning the gratings on the optical axis of x-rays with a sepn. that caused the Talbot effect by the 1st grating, moire fringes were produced inclining 1 grating slightly against the other around the optical axis.  A phase object placed in front of the 1st grating was detected by moire-fringe bending.  Using the technique of phase-shifting interferometry, the differential phase corresponding to the phase object could also be measured.  Probably x-ray Talbot interferometry is a novel and simple method for phase-sensitive x-ray radiog.\n",

      "X-ray radiog. absorption imaging is an important tool in medical diagnostics and materials science.  However, for biol. tissue samples, polymers or fiber composites, the use of conventional X-ray radiog. is limited due to their weak absorption.  This is resolved at highly brilliant X-ray synchrotron or micro-focus sources by using phase-sensitive imaging methods to improve the contrast.  However, the requirements of the illuminating radiation mean that hard-X-ray phase-sensitive imaging has until now been impractical with more readily available X-ray sources, such as X-ray tubes.  A grating-based differential phase-contrast setup is presented which can be efficiently used to retrieve quant. phase images with conventional X-ray tubes.  The setup consists of three transmission gratings, namely source, phase, and analyzer absorption gratings.  In contrast with existing techniques, the method requires no spatial or temporal coherence, is mech. robust, and can be scaled up to large fields of view.  The method provides all the benefits of contrast-enhanced phase-sensitive imaging, but is also fully compatible with conventional absorption radiog.  It is applicable to X-ray medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing, and to other low-brilliance radiation, such as neutrons or atoms.\n",

      "Imaging with visible light today uses numerous contrast mechanisms, including bright- and dark-field contrast, phase-contrast schemes and confocal and fluorescence-based methods.  X-ray imaging, however, has only recently seen the development of an analogous variety of contrast modalities.  Although x-ray phase-contrast imaging could successfully be implemented at a relatively early stage with several techniques, dark-field imaging, or more generally scattering-based imaging, with hard x-rays and good signal-to-noise ratio, in practice still remains a challenging task even at highly brilliant synchrotron sources.  The authors report a new approach from a grating interferometer that can efficiently yield dark-field scatter images of high quality, even with conventional x-ray tube sources.  Because the image contrast is formed through the mechanism of small-angle scattering, it provides complementary and otherwise inaccessible structural information about the specimen at the micrometer and submicrometer length scale.  The authors' approach is fully compatible with conventional transmission radiog. and a recently developed hard-x-ray phase-contrast imaging scheme.  Applications to x-ray medical imaging, industrial nondestructive testing and security screening are discussed.\n",

      "Disorders of the lungs such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality and the third leading cause of death in the world.  The absence of sensitive diagnostic tests for early disease stages of COPD results in under-diagnosis of this treatable disease in an estd. 60-85% of the patients.  In recent years a grating-based approach to X-ray dark-field contrast imaging has shown to be very sensitive for the detection and quantification of pulmonary emphysema in small animal models.  However, translation of this technique to imaging systems suitable for humans remains challenging and has not yet been reported.  In this manuscript, we present the first X-ray dark-field images of in-situ human lungs in a deceased body, demonstrating the feasibility of X-ray dark-field chest radiog. on a human scale.  Results were correlated with findings of computed tomog. imaging and autopsy.  The performance of the exptl. radiog. setup allows acquisition of multi-contrast chest X-ray images within clin. boundary conditions, including radiation dose.  Upcoming clin. studies will have to demonstrate that this technol. has the potential to improve early diagnosis of COPD and pulmonary diseases in general.\n",

      "Grating-based X-ray dark-field imaging is a novel imaging modality which has been refined during the last decade.  It exploits the wave-like behaviour of X-radiation and can nowadays be implemented with existing X-ray tubes used in clinical applications.  The method is based on the detection of small-angle X-ray scattering, which occurs e.g. at air-tissue-interfaces in the lung or bone-fat interfaces in spongy bone.  In contrast to attenuation-based chest X-ray imaging, the optimal tube voltage for dark-field imaging of the thorax has not yet been examined.  In this work, dark-field scans with tube voltages ranging from 60 to 120 kVp were performed on a deceased human body.  We analyzed the resulting images with respect to subjective and objective image quality, and found that the optimum tube voltage for dark-field thorax imaging at the used setup is at rather low energies of around 60 to 70 kVp.  Furthermore, we found that at these tube voltages, the transmission radiographs still exhibit sufficient image quality to correlate dark-field information.  Therefore, this study may serve as an important guideline for the development of clinical dark-field chest X-ray imaging devices for future routine use.\n",

      "Here, we present a functional assay to detect the repair switch to the alternative PARP1-dependent end joining (PARP1-EJ) pathway and the associated susceptibility to PARPi-mediated radiosensitization in freshly collected tumor samples from prostate cancer (PCa) patients, thereby facilitating the selection of patients who should benefit from combined PARPi plus radiotherapy (RT) treatment.  Our optimized ex-vivo approach sustains tumor slices for up to 15 days under culture conditions that maintain proliferation and oxygenation rates, as measured by EdU incorporation and pimonidazole staining, respectively.  We present a robust system to analyze DSB repair using, for the first time in an ex vivo tumor slice setting, two DSB-markers simultaneously i.e. γH2AX and 53BP1.  A computer-based processing method (i) controls variations in DNA content and slicing on the number of repair foci and (ii) measures the PARPi-mediated enhancement ratio on DSB foci numbers to ensure inter-patient-comparability.  We validated this approach using a PC3 xenograft model with its previously described repair switch to PARP1-EJ.  More importantly, we show that approximately 30% of the analyzed tumor tissue samples collected from PCa patients display a switch to PARP1-EJ, as indicated by the enhanced number of residual γH2AX/53BP1 foci exclusively after PARPi+RT.  Furthermore, normal prostatic tissues show no repair switch to PARP1-EJ, indicating that this repair switch and its associated radiosensitizing effect is tumor-specific.  Collectively, we present here a predictive assay for the switch to PARP1-EJ that enables individualization of anti-cancer treatment using a combination of RT and radiosensitizing anticancer agents such as PARPi in PCa.\n",

      "A review.  Cancer occurs when cells acquire genomic instability and inflammation, produce abnormal levels of epigenetic factors/proteins and tumor suppressors, reprogram the energy metab. and evade immune destruction, leading to the disruption of cell cycle/normal growth.  An early event in carcinogenesis is loss of polarity and detachment from the natural basement membrane, allowing cells to form distinct three-dimensional (3D) structures that interact with each other and with the surrounding microenvironment.  Although valuable information has been accumulated from traditional in vitro studies in which cells are grown on flat and hard plastic surfaces (2D culture), this culture condition does not reflect the essential features of tumor tissues.  Further, fundamental understanding of cancer metastasis cannot be obtained readily from 2D studies because they lack the complex and dynamic cell-cell communications and cell-matrix interactions that occur during cancer metastasis.  These shortcomings, along with lack of spatial depth and cell connectivity, limit the applicability of 2D cultures to accurate testing of pharmacol. active compds., free or sequestered in nanoparticles.  To recapitulate features of native tumor microenvironments, various biomimetic 3D tumor models have been developed to incorporate cancer and stromal cells, relevant matrix components, and biochem. and biophys. cues, into one spatially and temporally integrated system.  In this article, we review recent advances in creating 3D tumor models employing tissue engineering principles.  We then evaluate the utilities of these novel models for the testing of anticancer drugs and their delivery systems.  We highlight the profound differences in responses from 3D in vitro tumors and conventional monolayer cultures.  Overall, strategic integration of biol. principles and engineering approaches will both improve understanding of tumor progression and invasion and support discovery of more personalized first line treatments for cancer patients.\n",

      "The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of bioreactor-based culture systems as alternatives to conventional two- and three-dimensional counterparts.  The role, challenges, and future aspirations of bioreactors in the musculoskeletal field (e.g., cartilage, intervertebral disc, tendon, and bone) are discussed.  Bioreactors, by recapitulating physiological processes, can be used effectively as part of the initial in vitro screening, reducing that way the number of animal required for preclinical assessment, complying with the 3R principles and, in most cases, allowing working with human tissues.  The clinical significance of bioreactors is that, by providing more physiologically relevant conditions to customarily used two- and three-dimensional cultures, they hold the potential to provide a testing platform that is more predictable of a whole tissue response, thereby facilitating the screening of treatments before the initiation of clinical trials. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

      "BACKGROUND & AIMS:  We conducted a systematic review to determine changes in the worldwide incidence and prevalence of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) in different regions and with time.  METHODS:  We performed a systematic literature search of MEDLINE (1950-2010; 8103 citations) and EMBASE (1980-2010; 4975 citations) to identify studies that were population based, included data that could be used to calculate incidence and prevalence, and reported separate data on UC and/or CD in full manuscripts (n = 260).  We evaluated data from 167 studies from Europe (1930-2008), 52 studies from Asia and the Middle East (1950-2008), and 27 studies from North America (1920-2004).  Maps were used to present worldwide differences in the incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs); time trends were determined using joinpoint regression.  RESULTS:  The highest annual incidence of UC was 24.3 per 100,000 person-years in Europe, 6.3 per 100,000 person-years in Asia and the Middle East, and 19.2 per 100,000 person-years in North America.  The highest annual incidence of CD was 12.7 per 100,000 person-years in Europe, 5.0 person-years in Asia and the Middle East, and 20.2 per 100,000 person-years in North America.  The highest reported prevalence values for IBD were in Europe (UC, 505 per 100,000 persons; CD, 322 per 100,000 persons) and North America (UC, 249 per 100,000 persons; CD, 319 per 100,000 persons).  In time-trend analyses, 75% of CD studies and 60% of UC studies had an increasing incidence of statistical significance (P < .05).  CONCLUSIONS:  Although there are few epidemiologic data from developing countries, the incidence and prevalence of IBD are increasing with time and in different regions around the world, indicating its emergence as a global disease.\n",

      "The cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) was thought to have a central role in T cell-mediated responses in inflammation for more than a decade after it was first identified.  Discovery of the cytokine IL-23, which shares a common p40 subunit with IL-12, prompted efforts to clarify the relative contribution of these two cytokines in immune regulation.  Ustekinumab, a therapeutic agent targeting both cytokines, was recently approved to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and related agents are in clin. testing for a variety of inflammatory disorders.  Here we discuss the therapeutic rationale for targeting these cytokines, the unintended consequences for host defense and tumor surveillance and potential ways in which these therapies can be applied to treat addnl. immune disorders.\n",

      "Genome-wide assocn. studies have identified loci underlying human diseases, but the causal nucleotide changes and mechanisms remain largely unknown.  Here the authors developed a fine-mapping algorithm to identify candidate causal variants for 21 autoimmune diseases from genotyping data.  The authors integrated these predictions with transcription and cis-regulatory element annotations, derived by mapping RNA and chromatin in primary immune cells, including resting and stimulated CD4+ T-cell subsets, regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes.  The authors find that ∼90% of causal variants are non-coding, with ∼60% mapping to immune-cell enhancers, many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer-assocd. RNA upon immune stimulation.  Causal variants tend to occur near binding sites for master regulators of immune differentiation and stimulus-dependent gene activation, but only 10-20% directly alter recognizable transcription factor binding motifs.  Rather, most non-coding risk variants, including those that alter gene expression, affect non-canonical sequence determinants not well-explained by current gene regulatory models.\n",

      "Summary: T helper 17 (Th17) cells are important for host defense against extracellular microorganisms.  However, they are also implicated in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, and as such need to be tightly regulated.  The mechanisms that directly control committed pathogenic Th17 cells in vivo remain unclear.  We showed here that IL-17A-producing CD4+ T cells expressed interleukin-10 receptor α (IL-10Rα) in vivo.  Importantly, T cell-specific blockade of IL-10 signaling led to a selective increase of IL-17A+IFN-γ- (Th17) and IL-17A+IFN-γ+ (Th17+Th1) CD4+ T cells during intestinal inflammation in the small intestine.  CD4+Foxp3- IL-10-producing (Tr1) cells and CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory (Treg) cells were able to control Th17 and Th17+Th1 cells in an IL-10-dependent manner in vivo.  Lastly, IL-10 treatment of mice with established colitis decreased Th17 and Th17+Th1 cell frequencies via direct signaling in T cells.  Thus, IL-10 signaling directly suppresses Th17 and Th17+Th1 cells.\n",

      "Summary: Effector CD4+ T cell subsets, whose differentiation is facilitated by distinct cytokine cues, amplify the corresponding type of inflammatory response.  Regulatory T (Treg) cells integrate environmental cues to suppress particular types of inflammation.  In this regard, STAT3, a transcription factor essential for T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation, is necessary for Treg cell-mediated control of Th17 cell responses.  Here, we showed that anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10), and not proinflammatory IL-6 and IL-23 cytokine signaling, endowed Treg cells with the ability to suppress pathogenic Th17 cell responses.  Ablation of the IL-10 receptor in Treg cells resulted in selective dysregulation of Th17 cell responses and colitis similar to that obsd. in mice harboring STAT3-deficient Treg cells.  Thus, Treg cells limit Th17 cell inflammation by serving as principal amplifiers of neg. regulatory circuits operating in immune effector cells.\n",

      "The mol. cause of inflammatory bowel disease is largely unknown.  We performed genetic-linkage anal. and candidate-gene sequencing on samples from two unrelated consanguineous families with children who were affected by early-onset inflammatory bowel disease.  We screened six addnl. patients with early-onset colitis for mutations in two candidate genes and carried out functional assays in patients' peripheral-blood mononuclear cells.  We performed an allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in one patient.  In four of nine patients with early-onset colitis, we identified three distinct homozygous mutations in genes IL10RA and IL10B, encoding the IL10R1 and IL10R2 proteins, resp., which form a heterotetramer to make up the interleukin-10 receptor.  The mutations abrogate interleukin-10-induced signaling, as shown by deficient STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) phosphorylation on stimulation with interleukin-10.  Consistent with this observation was the increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor a and other proinflammatory cytokines from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from patients who were deficient in IL10R subunit proteins, suggesting that interleukin-10-dependent \"neg. feedback\" regulation is disrupted in these cells.  The allogeneic stem-cell transplantation performed in one patient was successful.  Mutations in genes encoding the IL10R subunit proteins were found in patients with early-onset enterocolitis, involving hyperinflammatory immune responses in the intestine.  Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation resulted in disease remission in one patient.\n",

      "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a heterogeneous group of gastrointestinal disorders, where commensal gut flora provokes an either (a) insufficient or (b) uncontrolled immune response.  This results either in a lack of or in excessive inflammation mainly manifesting as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.  IBD commonly presents in adolescence and adulthood and often follows a chronic relapsing course.  Genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to the failure of gut immune homeostasis.  Genome-wide assocn. studies have identified over 160 susceptibility loci assocd. with IBD, including polymorphisms in interleukin-10 (IL-10).  The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 dampens intestinal inflammation and is therefore a good candidate gene for IBD.  Polymorphisms in the IL-10 receptor are also assocd. with ulcerative colitis presenting in early childhood.  Moreover, severe infantile enterocolitis resembling Crohn's disease, caused by loss-of-function mutations in IL-10 and IL-10 receptor, is characterized by a very early onset (usually within the first 3 mo of life), unresponsiveness to std. treatment including immunosuppressive therapy, and severe perianal disease with abscesses and fistulas.  In these patients, inflammation and polymorphic infiltrates are mainly confined to the colon with very little involvement of the small intestine.  Ulceration and granulomas, bloody diarrhea and failure to thrive also occur.  Furthermore, patients may suffer from recurrent fever and respiratory infections.  Individuals with IL-10 receptor mutations also experience cutaneous folliculitis and arthritis.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the only curative therapy.\n",

      "Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment method, but its applications are limited by the shallow penetration of visible light.  Here, we report a novel X-ray inducible photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) approach that allows PDT to be regulated by X-rays.  Upon X-ray irradn., the integrated nanosystem, comprised of a core of a nanoscintillator and a mesoporous silica coating loaded with photosensitizers, converts X-ray photons to visible photons to activate the photosensitizers and cause efficient tumor shrinkage.\n",

      "Achieving effective treatment of deep-seated tumors is a major challenge for traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to difficulties in delivering light into the subsurface.  Thanks to their great tissue penetration, X-rays hold the potential to become an ideal excitation source for activating photosensitizers (PS) that accumulate in deep tumor tissue.  Recently, a wide variety of nanoparticles have been developed for this purpose.  The nanoparticles are designed as carriers for loading various kinds of PSs and can facilitate the activation process by transferring energy harvested from X-ray irradn. to the loaded PS.  In this review, we focus on recent developments of nanoscintillators with high energy transfer efficiency, their rational designs, as well as potential applications in next-generation PDT.  Treatment of deep-seated tumors by using radioisotopes as an internal light source will also be discussed.\n",

      "A review.  Radiotherapy is one of the major therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.  In the past decade, there has been growing interest in using high Z (at. no.) elements (materials) as radiosensitizers.  New strategies in nanomedicine could help to improve cancer diagnosis and therapy at cellular and mol. levels.  Metal-based nanoparticles usually exhibit chem. inertness in cellular and subcellular systems and may play a role in radiosensitization and synergistic cell-killing effects for radiation therapy.  This review summarizes the efficacy of metal-based NanoEnhancers against cancers in both in vitro and in vivo systems for a range of ionizing radiations including gamma-rays, X-rays, and charged particles.  The potential of translating preclin. studies on metal-based nanoparticles-enhanced radiation therapy into clin. practice is also discussed using examples of several metal-based NanoEnhancers (such as CYT-6091, AGuIX, and NBTXR3).  Also, a few general examples of theranostic multimetallic nanocomposites are presented, and the related biol. mechanisms are discussed.\n",

      "Nanoparticles (NPs) contg. high at. no. (high-Z) materials have been shown to enhance the radiobiol. effectiveness of ionizing radiation.  This effect is often attributed to an enhancement of the absorbed dose in the vicinity of the NPs, based on Monte Carlo simulations that show a significant local enhancement of the energy deposition on the microscopic scale.  The results of such simulations may be significantly biased and lead to a severe overestimation of the dose enhancement if the condition of secondary particle equil. is not met in the simulation setup.  This current work shows an approach to est. a 'realistic' dose enhancement from the results of such biased simulations which is based on published photon interaction data and provides a way for correcting biased results.\n",

      "Gold nanoparticle (GNP) radio-enhancement is a promising technique to increase the dose deposition in a tumor while sparing neighboring healthy tissue.  Previous exptl. studies showed effects on cell survival and tumor control for keV x-rays but surprisingly also for MV-photons, proton and carbon-ion beams.  In a systematic study, we use the Monte Carlo simulation tool TOPAS-nBio to model the GNP radio-enhancement within a cell as a function of GNP concn., size and clustering for a wide range of energies for photons, protons and, for the first time, carbon-ions.  Moreover, we include water radiolysis, which has been recognized as a major pathway of GNP mediated radio-enhancement.  At a GNP concn. of 0.5% and a GNP diam. of 10 nm, the dose enhancement ratio was highest for 50 keV x-rays (1.36) and decreased in the orthovoltage (1.04 at 250 keV) and megavoltage range (1.01 at 1 MeV).  The dose enhancement linearly increased with GNP concn. and decreased with GNP size and degree of clustering for all radiation modalities.  While the highest phys. dose enhancement at 5% concns. was only 1.003 for 10 MeV protons and 1.004 for 100 MeV carbon-ions, we find the no. of hydroxyl (•OH) altered by 23% and 3% after 1μs at low, clin.-relevant concns.  For the same concn. and proton-impact, the G-value is most sensitive to the nanoparticle size with 46 times more radical interactions at GNPs for 2 nm than for 50 nm GNP diam. within 1μs.  Nanoparticle clustering was found to decrease the no. of interactions at GNPs, e.g. for a cluster of 25 GNPs by a factor of 3.4.  The changes in G-value correlate to the av. distance between the chem. species and the GNPs.  While the radiochem. of GNP-loaded water has yet to be fully understood, this work offers a first relative quantification of radiolysis products for a broad parameter-set.\n",

      "The radiosensitizing effect of 5-250 nm diam. Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) in water was investigated under irradiations of diagnostic X-ray and UV light.  Enhanced generations of hydroxyl radical (OH) and superoxide anion (O-2) were confirmed from their dependencies on the absorbed energy, ethanol concn. and AuNPs' concn.  Two kinds of fluorescent probes revealed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate under X-ray irradn. was enhanced by factors of 1.46 for OH and 7.68 for O-2.  Photo- and Auger electron charge transfer is possibly relevant to generation of O-2 near the particle surface, whereas fluorescent X-rays are involved in generation of OH in the secondary water radiolysis.  Smaller diam. AuNPs with larger surface area showed a greater yield of ROS.  An inverse proportion of ROS generation to the AuNPs' diam. suggests a catalytic function of AuNPs' surface for enhanced ROS generation.\n",

      "The abs. yield of hydroxyl radicals per unit of deposited X-ray energy is detd. for the first time for irradiated aq. solns. contg. metal nanoparticles based on a \"ref.\" protocol.  Measurements are made as a function of dose rate and nanoparticle concn.  Possible mechanisms for hydroxyl radical prodn. are considered in turn: energy deposition in the nanoparticles followed by its transport into the surrounding environment is unable to account for obsd. yield whereas energy deposition in the water followed by a catalytic-like reaction at the water-nanoparticle interface can account for the total yield and its dependence on dose rate and nanoparticle concn.  This finding is important because current models used to account for nanoparticle enhancement to radiobiol. damage only consider the primary interaction with the nanoparticle, not with the surrounding media.  Nothing about the new mechanism appears to be specific to gold, the main requirements being the formation of a structured water layer in the vicinity of the nanoparticle possibly through the interaction of its charge and the water dipoles.  The massive hydroxyl radical prodn. is relevant to a no. of application fields, particularly nanomedicine since the hydroxyl radical is responsible for the majority of radiation-induced DNA damage.\n",

      "The Coulomb nanoradiator (CNR) effect produces the dose enhancement effects from high-Z nanoparticles under irradn. with a high-energy ion beam.  To gain insight into the radiation dose and biol. significance of the CNR effect, the enhancement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) prodn. from iron oxide or gold NPs (IONs or AuNPs, resp.) in water was investigated using traversing proton beams.  The dependence of nanoradiator-enhanced ROS prodn. on the at. Z value and proton energy was investigated.  Two biol. important ROS species were measured using fluorescent probes specific to •OH or in a series of water phantoms contg. either AuNPs or IONs under irradn. with a 45- or 100-MeV proton beam.  The enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and superoxide anions () was detd. to be caused by the dependence on the NP concn. and proton energy.  The proton-induced Au or iron oxide nanoradiators exhibited different ROS enhancement rates depending on the proton energy, suggesting that the CNR radiation varied.  The curve of the superoxide anion prodn. from the Au-nanoradiator showed strong non-linearity, unlike the linear behavior obsd. for hydroxyl radical prodn. and the X-ray photoelec. nanoradiator.  In addn., the 45-MeV proton-induced Au nanoradiator exhibited an ROS enhancement ratio of 8.54/1.50 ( / •OH), similar to that of the 100-KeV X-ray photoelec. Au nanoradiator (7.68/1.46).  The ROS-based detection of the CNR effect revealed its dependence on the proton beam energy, dose and at. Z value and provided insight into the low-linear energy transfer (LET) CNR radiation, suggesting that these factors may influence the therapeutic efficacy via chem. reactivities, transport behaviors, and intracellular oxidative stress.\n",

      "There is a fundamental interest in studying photoinduced dynamics in nanoparticles and nanostructures as it provides insight into their mech. and thermal properties out of equil. and during phase transitions.  Nanoparticles can display significantly different properties from the bulk, which is due to the interplay between their size, morphol., crystallinity, defect concn., and surface properties.  Particularly interesting scenarios arise when nanoparticles undergo phase transitions, such as melting induced by an optical laser.  Current theor. evidence suggests that nanoparticles can undergo reversible nonhomogenous melting with the formation of a core-shell structure consisting of a liq. outer layer.  To date, studies from ensembles of nanoparticles have tentatively suggested that such mechanisms are present.  Here we demonstrate imaging transient melting and softening of the acoustic phonon modes of an individual gold nanocrystal, using an X-ray free electron laser.  The results demonstrate that the transient melting is reversible and nonhomogenous, consistent with a core-shell model of melting.  The results have implications for understanding transient processes in nanoparticles and detg. their elastic properties as they undergo phase transitions.\n",

      "Sample damage by X-rays and other radiation limits the resoln. of structural studies on non-repetitive and non-reproducible structures such as individual biomols. or cells.  Cooling can slow sample deterioration, but cannot eliminate damage-induced sample movement during the time needed for conventional measurements.  Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per Å2 with X-rays of 12keV energy or 1Å wavelength) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times.  Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein mols. and small assemblies.  Estns. of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that expts. using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample.  We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural detns. with X-rays.\n",

      "Photo-induced removal of CO from Fe(CO)5 in soln. has been shown to generate the 16-electron Fe(CO)4 species, a homogeneous catalyst with an electron deficiency at the Fe center, in an excited singlet state that either converts to the triplet ground state or combines with a CO or solvent mol. to regenerate a penta-coordinated Fe species on a sub-picosecond timescale.

      "A review.  The development and application of the free-electron X-ray laser (XFEL) to structure and dynamics in biol. since its inception in 2009 are reviewed.  The research opportunities which result from the ability to outrun most radiation-damage effects are outlined, and some grand challenges are suggested.  By avoiding the need to cool samples to minimize damage, the XFEL has permitted at. resoln. imaging of mol. processes on the 100 fs timescale under near-physiol. conditions and in the correct thermal bath in which mol. machines operate.  Radiation damage, comparisons of XFEL and synchrotron work, single-particle diffraction, fast soln. scattering, pump-probe studies on photosensitive proteins, mix-and-inject expts., caged mols., pH jump and other reaction-initiation methods, and the study of mol. machines are all discussed.  Sample-delivery methods and data-anal. algorithms for the various modes, from serial femtosecond crystallog. to fast soln. scattering, fluctuation X-ray scattering, mixing jet expts. and single-particle diffraction, are also reviewed.\n",

      "A review.  Coherent X-ray diffractive imaging (CXDI) is a new imaging technique that offers the potential to image non-cryst. materials to sub-nanometer resolns.  Here we review the progress in CXDI of biol. samples at both synchrotron and free electron laser (FEL) sources.  We outline the exptl. design of a CXDI expt. and summarize the iterative phase retrieval techniques that are used to produce images from the measured diffraction patterns.  We describe a selection of key expts. performed in bio-imaging with CXDI from synchrotron sources, and we discuss the proof-of-principle expts. performed at FLASH at DESY in Hamburg.  Finally, we show through simulation that for realistic parameters of hard X-ray FELs a resoln. of a few nanometers may be achieved for individual biol. objects imaged with single pulses of FEL radiation.  Furthermore, we revise how this resoln. may be improved to the sub-nanometer range if we image multiple copies of samples with a reproducible structure.\n",

      "There exists a conspicuous gap of knowledge about the organization of life at mesoscopic levels.  Ultra-fast coherent diffractive imaging with X-ray free-electron lasers can probe structures at the relevant length scales and may reach sub-nanometer resoln. on micron-sized living cells.  Here we show that we can introduce a beam of aerosolised cyanobacteria into the focus of the Linac Coherent Light Source and record diffraction patterns from individual living cells at very low noise levels and at high hit ratios.  We obtain two-dimensional projection images directly from the diffraction patterns, and present the results as synthetic X-ray Nomarski images calcd. from the complex-valued reconstructions.  We further demonstrate that it is possible to record diffraction data to nanometer resoln. on live cells with X-ray lasers.  Extension to sub-nanometer resoln. is within reach, although improvements in pulse parameters and X-ray area detectors will be necessary to unlock this potential.\n",

      "The authors overcome two of the most daunting challenges in single-particle diffractive imaging: collecting many high-quality diffraction patterns on a small amt. of sample and sepg. components from mixed samples.  The authors demonstrate this on carboxysomes, which are polyhedral cell organelles that vary in size and facilitate up to 40% of Earth's carbon fixation.  A new aerosol sample-injector allowed the authors to record 70,000 low-noise diffraction patterns in 12 min with the Linac Coherent Light Source running at 120 Hz.  The authors sep. different structures directly from the diffraction data and show that the size distribution is preserved during sample delivery.  The authors automate phase retrieval and avoid reconstruction artifacts caused by missing modes.  The authors attain the highest-resoln. reconstructions on the smallest single biol. objects imaged with an x-ray laser to date.  These advances lay the foundations for accurate, high-throughput structure detn. by flash-diffractive imaging and offer a means to study structure and structural heterogeneity in biol. and elsewhere.\n",

      "X-ray lasers offer new capabilities in understanding the structure of biol. systems, complex materials and matter under extreme conditions.  Very short and extremely bright, coherent X-ray pulses can be used to outrun key damage processes and obtain a single diffraction pattern from a large macromol., a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into plasma.  The continuous diffraction pattern of non-cryst. objects permits oversampling and direct phase retrieval.  Here we show that high-quality diffraction data can be obtained with a single X-ray pulse from a non-cryst. biol. sample, a single mimivirus particle, which was injected into the pulsed beam of a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source.  Calcns. indicate that the energy deposited into the virus by the pulse heated the particle to over 100,000 K after the pulse had left the sample.  The reconstructed exit wavefront (image) yielded 32-nm full-period resoln. in a single exposure and showed no measurable damage.  The reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement of dense material inside the virion.  We expect that significantly higher resolns. will be achieved in such expts. with shorter and brighter photon pulses focused to a smaller area.  The resoln. in such expts. can be further extended for samples available in multiple identical copies.\n",

      "X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) open the possibility of obtaining diffraction information from a single biol. macromol.  This is because XFELs can generate extremely intense x-ray pulses that are so short that diffraction data can be collected before the sample is destroyed.  By collecting a sufficient no. of single-particle diffraction patterns, the three-dimensional electron d. of a mol. can be reconstructed ab initio.  The quality of the reconstruction depends largely on the no. of patterns collected at the expt.  This paper provides an est. of the no. of diffraction patterns required to reconstruct the electron d. at a targeted spatial resoln.  This est. is verified by simulations for realistic x-ray fluences, repetition rates, and exptl. conditions available at modern XFELs.  Employing the bacterial phytochrome as a model system, we demonstrate that sub-nanometer resoln. is within reach.  (c) 2020 American Institute of Physics.\n",

      "The emergence of femtosecond diffractive imaging with X-ray lasers has enabled pioneering structural studies of isolated particles, such as viruses, at nanometer length scales.  However, the issue of missing low frequency data significantly limits the potential of X-ray lasers to reveal sub-nanometer details of micrometer-sized samples.  We have developed a new technique of dark-field coherent diffractive imaging to simultaneously overcome the missing data issue and enable us to harness the unique contrast mechanisms available in dark-field microscopy.  Images of airborne particulate matter (soot) up to two microns in length were obtained using single-shot diffraction patterns obtained at the Linac Coherent Light Source, four times the size of objects previously imaged in similar expts.  This technique opens the door to femtosecond diffractive imaging of a wide range of micrometer-sized materials that exhibit irreproducible complexity down to the nanoscale, including airborne particulate matter, small cells, bacteria and gold-labeled biol. samples.\n",

Here we report the crystn. and x-ray structure detn. of a p-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA)-protected gold nanoparticle, which comprises 102 gold atoms and 44 p-MBAs.  The central gold atoms are packed in a Marks decahedron, surrounded by addnl. layers of gold atoms in unanticipated geometries.  The p-MBAs interact not only with the gold but also with one another, forming a rigid surface layer.  The particles are chiral, with the two enantiomers alternating in the crystal lattice.

      "A review.  Phytochromes are environmental sensors, historically thought of as red/far-red photoreceptors in plants.  Their photoperception occurs through a covalently linked tetrapyrrole chromophore, which undergoes a light-dependent conformational change propagated through the protein to a variable output domain.  The phytochrome compn. is modular, typically consisting of a PAS-GAF-PHY architecture for the N-terminal photosensory core.  A collection of three-dimensional structures has uncovered key features, including an unusual figure-of-eight knot, an extension reaching from the PHY domain to the chromophore-binding GAF domain, and a centrally located, long αα-helix hypothesized to be crucial for intramol. signaling.  Continuing identification of phytochromes in microbial systems has expanded the assigned sensory abilities of this family out of the red and into the yellow, green, blue, and violet portions of the spectrum.  Furthermore, phytochromes acting not as photoreceptors but as redox sensors have been recognized.  In addn., architectures other than PAS-GAF-PHY are known, thus revealing phytochromes to be a varied group of sensory receptors evolved to utilize their modular design to perceive a signal and respond accordingly.  This review focuses on the structures of bacterial phytochromes and implications for signal transmission.  We also discuss the small but growing set of bacterial phytochromes for which a physiol. function has been ascertained.\n",

      "Phytochromes are photochromic photoreceptors responsible for a myriad of red/far-red light-dependent processes in plants and microorganisms.  Interconversion is initially driven by photoreversible isomerization of bilin, but how this alteration directs the photostate-dependent changes within the protein to actuate signaling is poorly understood.  Here, we describe the structure of the Deinococcus phytochrome photosensory module in its near complete far-red light-absorbing Pfr state.  In addn. to confirming the 180° rotation of the D-pyrrole ring, the dimeric structure clearly identifies downstream rearrangements that trigger large-scale conformational differences between the dark-adapted and photoactivated states.  Mutational analyses verified the importance of residues surrounding the bilin in Pfr stabilization, and protease sensitivity assays corroborated photostate alterations that propagate along the dimeric interface.  Collectively, these data support a cooperative \"toggle\" model for phytochrome photoconversion and advance our understanding of the allosteric connection between the photosensory and output modules.\n",

      "Phytochromes (PHYs) are photoreceptor proteins first discovered in plants, where they control a variety of photomorphogenesis events.  PHYs as photochromic proteins can reversibly switch between two distinct states: a red light (Pr) and a far-red light (Pfr) absorbing form.  The discovery of Bacteriophytochromes (BphPs) in nonphotosynthetic bacteria has opened new frontiers in our understanding of the mechanisms by which these natural photoswitches can control single cell development, although the role of BphPs in vivo remains largely unknown.  BphPs are dimeric proteins that consist of a photosensory core module (PCM) and an enzymic domain, often a histidine kinase.  The PCM is composed of three domains (PAS, GAF, and PHY).  It holds a covalently bound open-chain tetrapyrrole (biliverdin, BV) chromophore.  Upon absorption of light, the double bond between BV rings C and D isomerizes and reversibly switches the protein between Pr and Pfr states.  We report crystal structures of the wild-type and mutant (His275Thr) forms of the canonical BphP from the nonphotosynthetic myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca (SaBphP2) in the Pr state.  Structures were detd. at 1.65 Å and 2.2 Å (resp.), the highest resoln. of any PCM construct to date.  We also report the room temp. wild-type structure of the same protein detd. at 2.1 Å at the SPring-8 Angstrom Compact free electron LAser (SACLA), Japan.  Our results not only highlight and confirm important amino acids near the chromophore that play a role in Pr-Pfr photoconversion but also describe the signal transduction into the PHY domain which moves across tens of angstroms after the light stimulus.

      "Sensory proteins must relay structural signals from the sensory site over large distances to regulatory output domains.  Phytochromes are a major family of red-light-sensing kinases that control diverse cellular functions in plants, bacteria and fungi.  Bacterial phytochromes consist of a photosensory core and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain.  Structures of photosensory cores are reported in the resting state and conformational responses to light activation have been proposed in the vicinity of the chromophore.  However, the structure of the signaling state and the mechanism of downstream signal relay through the photosensory core remain elusive.  Here we report crystal and soln. structures of the resting and activated states of the photosensory core of the bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans.  The structures show an open and closed form of the dimeric protein for the activated and resting states, resp.  This nanometer-scale rearrangement is controlled by refolding of an evolutionarily conserved 'tongue', which is in contact with the chromophore.  The findings reveal an unusual mechanism in which at.-scale conformational changes around the chromophore are first amplified into an angstrom-scale distance change in the tongue, and further grow into a nanometer-scale conformational signal.  The structural mechanism is a blueprint for understanding how phytochromes connect to the cellular signaling network.\n",

      "The routine at. resoln. structure detn. of single particles is expected to have profound implications for probing structure-function relationships in systems ranging from energy-storage materials to biol. mols.  Extremely bright ultrashort-pulse X-ray sources - X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) - provide X-rays that can be used to probe ensembles of nearly identical nanoscale particles.  When combined with coherent diffractive imaging, these objects can be imaged; however, as the resoln. of the images approaches the at. scale, the measured data are increasingly difficult to obtain and, during an X-ray pulse, the no. of photons incident on the 2D detector is much smaller than the no. of pixels.  This latter concern, the signal 'sparsity', materially impedes the application of the method.  An exptl. analog using a conventional X-ray source is demonstrated and yields signal levels comparable with those expected from single biomols. illuminated by focused XFEL pulses.  The analog expt. provides an invaluable cross check on the fidelity of the reconstructed data that is not available during XFEL expts.  Using these exptl. data, it is established that a sparsity of order 1.3 × 10-3 photons per pixel per frame can be overcome, lending vital insight to the soln. of the at. resoln. XFEL single-particle imaging problem by exptl. demonstrating 3D coherent diffractive imaging from photon-sparse random projections.\n",

      "X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) now routinely produce millijoule level pulses of x-ray photons with tens of femtoseconds duration.  Such x-ray intensities gave rise to the idea that weakly scattering particles-perhaps single biomols. or viruses-could be investigated free of radiation damage.  Here, we examine elements from the past decade of so-called single particle imaging with hard XFELs.  We look at the progress made to date and identify some future possible directions for the field.  In particular, we summarize the presently achieved resolns. as well as identifying the bottlenecks and enabling technologies to future resoln. improvement, which in turn enables application to samples of scientific interest.
